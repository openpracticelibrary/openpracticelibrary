  "bio": "I have been working with projects for 7 years and with people over 30. Understanding and solving a problem in the community is my passion since I understand myself as Jorge. My experience ranges from the largest multinationals in the world to startups that are only in the idea. I work as an Engagement Lead doing what I love: joining the need to transform with the innovation brought by Red Hat, taking the agile and Lean mentality to processes that need improvement, seeking to bring energy, dynamism, and practicing the collaboration of the Open Culture wherever I am."
