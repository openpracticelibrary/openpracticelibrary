The Open Practice Library is a community-driven repository of practices and tools. These are shared <i>by people</i> currently using them day-to-day <i>for people</i> looking to be inspired with new ideas and experience.

To help navigate the Library, all practices can be visualised on a canvas based on the [Outcome Delivery](http://outcomedelivery.com/) framework which has three parts:

* Discovery - to generate the Outcomes
* Options - to identify how to get there
* Delivery - to implement and put your ideas to the test. Learn what works and what doesnâ€™t.

These are connected with an infinity loop called Mobius. In addition to this is a foundation layer to capture practices providing culture & collaboration and technical engineering. These combined enable sustainable continuous delivery.

#### Our Mission
This Library is intended to be a wealth of knowledge on product Discovery and Delivery practices to be adopted and evolved by a positive, engaged and supportive global community.
