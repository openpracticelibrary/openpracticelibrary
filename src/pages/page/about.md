## Goals of this Library
This Library is intended to be a wealth of knowledge on product Discovery and Delivery practices to be adopted and evolved by a positive, engaged and supportive global community.

While this is intended for everyone who has an interest in learning more about the practices used by teams on a continuous journey of discovery and delivery building applications, this Open Practice Library has two main use cases in mind.

#### Share the Big Picture
Describe how people in this community use practices to accomplish engagement success. Learn how practices fit with each other and the way that we take individual practices to create seamless engagement delivery.

#### Search with Intent
Share details about a particular practice that community members use, learn perspectives on a particular practice and why practices are used, pointers on how to facilitate it, and when it should be employed.

## How to Fit These Practices into Your Existing Approach
While everybody has their approach to engagements, there is a need to identify particular outcomes that common practices look to accomplish.

So, the Open Practice Library has placed each practice on a visual canvas that includes the [Mobius Loop](http://www.mobiusloop.com) and a foundation layer. Mobius is an open source model created by Gabrielle Benefield and Ryan Shriver. Mobius is an open source model created by the [Outcome Delivery](http://www.outcomedelivery.com) community.

Practices are identified on one of areas of the canvas:


1. The "Why" area of the Discovery Loop - Why practices help describe purpose. Why are we doing this? What is the problem we need to solve or idea to pursue? Who are our target customers, and what do they need?

2. The "Outcomes" area of the Discovery Loop - Practices about Outcomes help establish where we want to get to, and how we will measure the customer and business needs are delivered. What are our objectives and deliverables?

3. The "Options" - Practices in the Options area help define what to work on first and what is enough Delivery before going to Discovery to define the next set of outcomes. What is the priority order of work items? Did we met our outcomes based on the deliverables? Did we disprove an outcome based on the deliverables?

4. The "Deliver" area of the Delivery Loop - Deliver practices help establish how we run experiments and deliver solutions to stakeholders and users.

5. The "Measure & Learn" area of the Delivery Loop - Measure is where we assess what really happened. Did we deliver a desired outcome? How much of an impact did we really make? How well did we do with the way we worked? Learn is the feedback loop that takes us back to the options pivot. This is where we learn what to do next.

6. The "Culture & Collaboration" area of the Foundation layer - Culture practices help provide the environment, establish team relationships, mindset and engagement to facilitate a smooth and continuous journey round Discovery and Delivery loops. Collaboration practices help facilitate conversation and alignment in a transparent and open manner facilitating successful Discovery and Delivery practices to be effective.

7. The "Technical" area of the Foundation layer - Technical practices enable the successful continuous and sustainable delivery of value from teams working on the discovery and delivery loops above.
