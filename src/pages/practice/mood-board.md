whatIs: The Mood Board is a collaborative practice to take time to discover and
  share inspiration for product solutions, features, and/or design elements.
  Team members take time to go search for ideas of what a solution might look
  like, then share those ideas and what they like about each one with the rest
  of the team.
whyDo: Mood Boards are a great way to find inspiration for your product. They
  can be used to find existing solutions to problems you're aiming to solve or
  specific features or design elements you think would be a great fit for your
  product. In giving all team members time to go out and explore existing
  solutions, it helps provide creativity and direction for the team, as well as
  specific design elements for your Product Designers to consider when either
  building a rapid prototype or new A/B test. Sharing ideas in this way helps
  speed up the process of what your solution should look like, decreasing the
  time it takes to design and test new ideas.
howTo: >-
  **Preparation:**


  * Create a board/space in your favorite online collaboration tool for members to put screenshots of their ideas. You can use Miro or Mural for this, or you can use moodboard-specific tools like [Milanote](https://milanote.com/product/moodboarding) or [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/)


  **Steps:**


  1. After aligning on a problem to solve or what your solution concept might be, have your product team members individually take 25-30 min to research ideas/products/services for inspiration on the internet.

  2. Copy/paste findings to the board (images, notes...)

  3. Keep an eye on what's being added, this could spark more great ideas!

  4. Play back and capture any big ideas that resonate with the group

  5. If you want to narrow down ideas, implement a round of [dot-voting ](https://gamestorming.com/dot-voting/)to have people select their favorite ideas/elements
