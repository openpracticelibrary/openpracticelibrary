  A Lean Canvas is a one-page document that captures key information about your
  future product. The Lean Canvas is frequently used by Entrepreneurs and Lean
  Startups.
howTo: >-
  When filling out the Lean Canvas, it is best to fill the sections out in a
  certain way.


  1. **Problem**

    When filling out the problem section think with your future customer in mind. WHY is this a problem for them?

  2. **Target Customer**

    Who are your early adopters of your product, specify them in terms of demographics, situation and interest.

  3. **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)** 

    Your UVP is directed to your customer, what makes your product or service so special to them? What is the benefit to them?

  4. **Solutions section**

    It focuses on the key features of your product or service. Ideally, each aspect of the solution comes in line with one of the previously mentioned problems.

  5. **Channels**

    How are you planning to promote your product? An example can be via 'word of mouth', colleagues, Instagram or Facebook.

  6. **Revenue Streams**

    This section is about how you will make money of your product. For example: Freemium - 1st month free then you would charge $2.99 per month.

  7. **Cost Structure**

    What are the costs you occur? An example here would be fees for Apple store or Google Pay.

  8. **Key Metrics**

    How do you measure your success? For example: Number of paid subscribers like 300 downloads in the first month.

  9. **Unfair Advantage**

    What makes your product unique. Something that cannot be easily copied or bought.


  When filling out the canvas, use bullet points. Don't write long sentences. A
  good canvas should be understood in a few minutes.


  Make sure you are filling out every box. There might be a lot of uncertainty
  but the canvas is there to help you and to structure your idea.

  ### Variations

  #### Lean Canvas

  The [Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com/leancanvas) was created by Ash Maurya
  and based on the [Business Model
  Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) by Alexander
  Osterwalder. It aims to shorten the product development lifecycle and rapidly
  discover if a product idea is viable.

  canvas](https://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/leanuxcanvas/) to help organizations

  #### UX Strategy Guide

  Arielle McMahon created the UX Strategy Guide to help product teams vet ideas
  for new products and features. This guide is inspired by the Lean UX Canvas
  and Jim Kalbach’s [UX Strategy
  Blueprint](https://experiencinginformation.com/2014/08/12/ux-strategy-blueprint/).


  The UX Strategy Guide provides a 12-step list of requirements, including
  metrics of success, risk assumptions, market research and more. Teams can
  follow the guide to validate product decisions with the right research and set
  their products up for success.


  Arielle McMahon has kindly contributed this guide to the Open Practice
  Library.
