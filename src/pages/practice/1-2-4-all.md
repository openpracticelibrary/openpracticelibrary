  1-2-4-All is a method for engaging all members of a large group simultaneously
  to generate ideas together.




  This method is highly scalable and can be used for almost any group size.
whyDo: >-
  * All voices are heard, incorporating “silent” conversations and expanding
  input diversity - No more HiPPOs (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion)!

  * Broad engagement naturally improves consensus and shared understanding

  * Iterative feedback improves outcomes
howTo: >-
  1. The facilitator asks a question about an issue,  problem to resolve, or a
  proposal to put forward (*e.g., What opportunities do YOU see for making
  progress on this challenge? How would you handle this situation? What ideas or
  actions do you recommend?*)

  2. Individuals self-reflect on the shared challenge \[1 min.]

  3. Individuals pair up to generate ideas in pairs, building on ideas from self-reflection. \[2 min.]

  4. Pairs group into foursomes to share and develop ideas from each pair. \[4 min.]

  5. Repeat cycle as needed.

  6. The facilitator pulls the entire group together to share and develop a common idea. \[5 min.]
