whatIs: 1-2-4-All is a method for engaging all members of a large group
  simultaneously to generate ideas together.  This method is highly scalable and
  can be used for almost any group size.
whyDo: >-
  * All voices are heard, incorporating “silent” conversations and expanding
  input diversity

  * Broad engagement naturally improves consensus and shared understanding

  * Iterative feedback improves outcomes
howTo: >-
  1. The facilitator asks a question in response to the presentation of an
  issue, or about a problem to resolve or a proposal put forward (e.g., What
  opportunities do YOU see for making progress on this challenge? How would you
  handle this situation? What ideas or actions do you recommend?)

  2. Individuals self-reflect on the shared challenge \[1 min.]

  3. Individuals pair up to generate ideas in pairs, building on ideas from self-reflection. \[2 min.]

  4. Pairs group into foursomes to share and develop ideas from each pair. \[4 min.]

  5. Repeat cycle as needed.

  6. The facilitator pulls the entire group together to share and develop a common idea. \[5 min.]
