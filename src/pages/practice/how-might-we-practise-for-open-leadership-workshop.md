howTo: >-
  Step 1: Review the Findings


  1. After the completion of the "Building Bridges: Tracing the Evolution of Teams" exercise, gather all participants together.

  2. Briefly recap the key findings and team stories shared during the previous exercise.

  3. Emphasize the importance of identifying the top crucial problems that surfaced during the team evolution discussions.


  Step 2: Shortlist Crucial Problems


  1. Provide each participant with a pen and a set of sticky notes.

  2. Instruct them to individually review the team stories displayed on the posters.

  3. Ask participants to identify and write down on separate sticky notes the top three-five crucial problems that teams have faced during their evolution and require to address or solve.


  Step 3: Share and Group the Problems


  1. Use the Dot voting practice to narrow down the top three problems.

  2. Invite each participant to dot vote by giving/assigning three dots to each participant and ask them to vote for the top three. (Refer to the dot-voting practice in the Open Practise library for more details and instructions)

  3. As participants share their problems, group similar issues together on a separate wall or board.

  4. Facilitate a brief discussion after each sharing to clarify and understand the nature of the identified problems.


  Step 4: Create "How Might We" (HMW) Statements


  1. With the grouped problems in front of the participants, explain the concept of "How Might We" (HMW) statements.

  2. Encourage the participants to rephrase each identified problem as a positive and actionable "How Might We" statement.

     * For example, if a problem was identified as "Lack of effective communication during the storming stage," the corresponding HMW statement could be "How might we improve communication to foster collaboration during the storming stage?"
  3. Participants should write their HMW statements on separate sticky notes and place them under the corresponding problem groups.


  Step 5: Inclusive Problem Solving


  1. Once all HMW statements are generated and placed under their respective problem groups, encourage participants to move around and review the statements.

  2. Invite participants to add to or modify existing HMW statements if they feel there are opportunities for improvement or enhancement.

  3. Foster an open and inclusive discussion, where participants can build on each other's ideas, seek clarifications, and collaboratively refine the HMW statements.


  Step 6: Reflect and Discuss


  1. After the inclusive problem-solving session, gather the participants back together for a final discussion.

  2. Facilitate a conversation around the refined HMW statements and the overall experience of inclusive problem-solving.

  3. Encourage participants to reflect on the power of collective thinking and the potential impact of these statements on addressing crucial team development challenges.


  Step 7: Identify Actionable Steps


  1. As a closing step, challenge participants to consider actionable steps to address the identified problems using the HMW statements as a starting point.

  2. Encourage participants to take ownership of these action steps and collaborate with relevant stakeholders to implement positive changes in their teams or the broader organization.


  Step 8: Acknowledge Inclusivity


  1. Thank all participants for actively engaging in the "How Might We" exercise and embracing the principle of inclusivity in problem-solving and decision-making.

  2. Highlight the significance of fostering an open organization that values diverse perspectives and encourages collaborative problem-solving for continuous improvement.
