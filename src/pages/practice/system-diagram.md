  1. Gather the team around a blank whiteboard


  2. Begin by drawing a large box in the middle of the canvas; this is your **System Boundary**


  3. As a team, define the main **Purpose** of the system in one brief sentence and write it above the box

  * If you struggle to define the Purpose in just one sentence, then the system might be too complex to describe, and you'll need to split it into multiple systems and diagrams


  4. Define one or more **Inputs** that the system will receive from external actors


  5. Define one or more **Outputs** that the system will provide to external actors


  6. Define one or more **Subsystems** that are inside the Boundar; these typically process the inputs, but may perform other tasks as well


  7. Define one or more **Feedback loops** that the system has in place to continously improve itself

  A system diagram is a simple and very high level description of a system that
  exists or needs to be built. It is a simple diagram that can be drawn
  collaboratively in little time. It can help a team get a clear, complete, and
  common understanding of a system.


  The components of a system diagram are:

  * The **Purpose**

  * The **System Boundary**

  * One or more **Inputs**

  * One or more **Outputs**

  * One or more **Subsystems**

  * One or more **Feedback Loops**

  The main enemy of system architects and software engineers is complexity.
  Complexity leads to a poor understanding of a system, which in turn can make
  the task of modifying or even using the system very challenging. The
  complexity of a system is reflected in its descriptions and documentation. The
  task of explaining a system to an audience of non technical people can be
  daunting. The System Diagram provides a simple method to solve this problem.


  Identifying and describing all the components of a System Diagram should enable a team to get a good understanding of the system. If the diagram is too complex, perhaps it needs to be broken down into multiple integrated systems.
