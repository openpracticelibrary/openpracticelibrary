  Dot Voting is a collaborative decision-making technique. It helps people to
  prioritise or select options from a range of choices. Participants use sticky
  dots or simply draw dots with a marker to visually indicate their preferences
  or priorities. 


  It is a simple and effective method for reaching consensus, making informed decisions, or allocating resources. Adding up the dots quickly shows 

  which are the most popular or important options.

  D﻿ot voting is quick and easy to facilitate, making it one of the most common
  and popular ways to move from generating options, to acting on them!


  **Prioritisation**\

  Dot Voting helps teams prioritise tasks, ideas, features, or projects. It allows members to focus on what is most important or valuable.


  **Consensus Building**\

  When a group needs to make a decision or reach a consensus, Dot Voting can highlight the most favoured options and guide discussion toward agreement.


  **Resource Allocation**\

  Teams can use Dot Voting to allocate limited resources to different initiatives, such as time or budget.


  **Idea Generation**\

  In brainstorming sessions, Dot Voting can identify the most promising ideas, helping teams select which concepts they might want to explore further, or act on.


  **Feedback Gathering**\

  Dot Voting is useful for collecting feedback or input from a large group quickly. It helps reveal the most common or important opinions.
howTo: >-
  **You will need:**


  * List of options to be voted on (written on a whiteboard, poster, or online)

  * Space for participants to place their dots next to the options.

  * Sticky dots or markers (each participant should have the same number of dots)


  **A﻿ction steps:**


  1. *Prepare the Options*: Write down the list of options or ideas that the group needs to prioritize. Ensure that the options are clear and well-defined.

  2. *Explain the Process*: Inform the participants about the purpose of Dot Voting and the number of dots they will receive. Typically, each person is given a specific number of dots (e.g., three or five), but you can adjust this based on the group size and the number of options.

  3. *Vote*: Participants place their dots next to the options they consider the most important or their top choices. They can distribute their dots freely, placing multiple dots on a single option or spreading them across different options.

  4. *Count the Dots*: After all participants have placed their dots, count the number of dots next to each option. The options with the most dots represent the group's collective preferences or priorities.

  5. *Discussion* (Optional): Depending on the context, you can facilitate a discussion to explore the reasons behind the choices or to reach a final decision. This discussion can help participants understand the group's thinking and make any necessary adjustments.

  6. *Final Decision*: Based on the results, make a final decision, allocate resources, or prioritize tasks accordingly.


  Dot Voting is a versatile and inclusive method for decision-making and prioritisation.  It encourages participation, provides a visual representation of preferences, and helps groups make informed choices. Whether you're working in a team, planning a project, or looking for a way to gather feedback, Dot Voting is a valuable tool for reaching a collective consensus.
