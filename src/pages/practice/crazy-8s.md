  Crazy 8’s is a core Design Sprint method. It is a fast sketching exercise that
  challenges people to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. The goal is
  to push beyond your first idea, frequently the least innovative, and to
  generate a wide variety of solutions to your challenge.

  Check out the video in the gallery for a quick overview.
whyDo: This practice is a great way to ensure a product team is taking the time
  to prioritize user needs and generate enough solutions to needs to broaden the
  potential for finding the best idea. Often times, a team generates a solution
  and begins development right away without considering whether a solution is a
  good one. But “good” is a relative term, so ideally teams should be generating
  a myriad of product solutions in order to compare and contrast and allow the
  best option to emerge.

  ### Steps


  1. Give each participant a single sheet of printer paper and a sharpie

  2. Have participants fold their paper into eight sections (it should look like the paper in the header image for this post)

  3. Set the timer for eight minutes

  4. Each team member sketches one idea in each rectangle

  5. When the timer goes off, put your pens down

  6. Have team members spend 2 min presenting their 8 ideas to everyone


  ### Follow-on Activities


  After the team presents ideas, you can run a [dot-voting exercise](http://www.funretrospectives.com/dot-voting/) to vote on which ideas and idea components the team likes the most. Afterwards, you can consolidate the ideas into a single idea to flesh out into a testable prototype.
