  Commitment to action


  This is a collaborative practice that invites everyone to commit to taking a first step towards action.  


  Inspired by the idea that 1000 mile journey begins with one step, action steps gets people to think about the first step they will take to continue the work begun together today. Informed by De Bono's Action shoes.
whyDo: >-
  Meetings can sometimes feel like they're all talk, and no action.  


  This is a quick and easy practice to get people to think about what they will do next, and put words into action. 


  It's also a great way to finish a workshop.

  continue that work beyond the meeting.

  Review: Use [Affinity Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/affinity-mapping/) to cluster and summarise action steps, or if there's a lot of actions to take, perhaps vote to prioritise what the group sees as most important to start with.
