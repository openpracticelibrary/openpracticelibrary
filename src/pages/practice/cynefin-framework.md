  The Cynefin Framework is a sense-making model that categorizes situations into
  five domains:


  * **Clear**: Cause-and-effect relationships exist. Best practices and standard operating procedures are effective.

  * **Complicated**: Cause-and-effect relationships can be determined through analysis. Experts can provide the best solutions.

  * **Complex**: Cause-and-effect relationships are only apparent retrospectively. Experimentation and adaptation are necessary.

  * **Chaotic**: No clear cause-and-effect relationships exist. Immediate action is required to stabilize the situation.


  **Disorder:** A state of ambiguity where it is unclear which domain a situation belongs to.
whyDo: >-
  

  * **Improved decision making:** Helps leaders choose the most appropriate response to a situation based on its complexity.

  * **Enhanced adaptability:** Enables organizations to respond effectively to changing circumstances.

  * **Better risk management:** Helps identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.

  * **Improved collaboration:** Fosters better communication and understanding among team members.
howTo: >-
  1. **Sense:** Observe the situation and gather information.

  2. **Categorize**: Determine which domain the situation belongs to (simple, complicated, complex, chaotic, or disorder).

  3. **Respond**: Select the appropriate response based on the domain:

  4. * **Clear**: Follow best practices.
     * **Complicated**: Analyze the situation and apply expert knowledge.
     * **Complex**: Experiment and adapt.
     * **Chaotic**: Act to stabilize the situation and then move to a more complex or complicated domain.
     * **Disorder**: Probe to understand the situation better and then categorize it.
  5. **Learn**: Reflect on the outcomes and adjust your approach as needed.
