  Scenario Casting is a collaborative tool for structuring software development
  projects - driven by domain expertise - expressed in scenarios. Scenario
  Casting is especially useful for getting to grips with complex or elusive
  domains. If your domain feels like this, and maybe a lot of people are
  involved, try Scenario Casting.


  A SCENARIO is an outline of some interesting *situation that implies a certain outcome*, e.g. "Ada orders a calzone pizza". It's as simple as that.


  A scenario is described from *domain perspective in pure domain language*. It is *concrete, detailed and distinctive*.


  A scenario *makes sense*. A good scenario is bursting with concrete information about the domain. It shows all relevant results along an exemplary business process and how they are related.


  A scenario *does NOT prescribe a solution*. It shows an *example of what is happening in the domain* to help people understand what they need a solution for.
whyDo: |-
  *A scenario is like a journey of discovery!* A scenario enables you to...

  * learn more about people, concerns, conventions, policies, things.
  * visit points of interest - and form your own impression of them.
  * cross borders and see how areas are connected.
  * make whole new discoveries and get ideas for future trips.
howTo: >-
  *Scenario Casting* is done collaboratively in *three iterative steps*:


  1. *Brainstorm example scenarios* of how individual ideas, questions and concerns affect the domain - strictly in domain language! This provides an initial *[Scenario Backlog](https://scenario-casting.org/#artifact-scenario-backlog)* outlining the problem space.

  2. *Prioritize* the *Scenario Backlog* and *agree on scope*.

  3. *Combine* the top scenarios into coherent overarching *[Orientation Scenarios](https://scenario-casting.org/#artifact-orientation-scenario)*.


  Then *flesh out and tell the stories* of the *Orientation Scenarios* in *collaborative modeling sessions* using


  *[Domain Storytelling](https://domainstorytelling.org/)* or *[Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/)*.


  A *Scenario Casting* is carried out *iteratively*. Whenever you start a *new iteration or phase of a project*, start with a *Scenario Casting*, to get an *overview of the domain* and to *set a focus for everyone involved*.


  If you already have a *bulging Scenario Backlog*, you can skip step 1 (brainstorming) and move on to step 2 (prioritizing). If the highest priority scenarios seem *manageable* and each seems *interesting enough on its own*, skip step 3 (combining) and flesh out the individual scenarios directly. *Scenario Casting* can be *extensive and in-depth* or *very short and concise* - depending on your situational needs. Keep it lightweight!
