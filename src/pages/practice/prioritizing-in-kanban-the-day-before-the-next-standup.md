whatIs: >-
  The team can be really diverse and you can have also introverted people.


  Agile principles can help with daily standups. Some people don't know which tasks should be taken first. Prioritizing in the evening before the next standup can help here.
whyDo: " Priorities of tasks can be changed daily with team meetings or finished
  tasks in neighbor teams. If all tasks in the Kanban board are ordered in the
  correct priority list in the morning, everybody can see and know the hot
  topics of the day. So all team members can pick up the tasks in the best
  possible order. That improves also the team work and the communication between
  all."
