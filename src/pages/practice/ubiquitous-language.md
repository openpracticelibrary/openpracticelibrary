whatIs: >-
  U﻿biquitous Language is a practice of building up a canonical, rigorous and
  unambigous language between everyone involved in the software development
  process. Usually a common shared language between the development team and the
  users, but not limited to that. The product owner and other stakeholders
  should adopt it as well.


  I﻿t comes from the Domain Driven Design world. I﻿t was first introduced by Eric Evans in his own book ["Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215/domainlanguag-20) in 2003.
whyDo: >-
  W﻿hen the business domain is very complex, it is common to find situations
  where t﻿eam members or users have a different understanding of the same
  concept.


  The lack of a shared understanding has a deep impact in the velocity and quality of what the development team delivers and can also lead to frustration in the users because what they have in mind is not what is finally implemented.


  Some examples of complex domain concepts:


  * ﻿*"Time travelling"* in AI model development domain

  * *"Merge vs Join"* in the data engineering domain.


  ﻿Developing Ubiquitous Language has many benefits. It helps to 


  * better understand the business domain and the users.

  * remove ambiguity from the development process.

  * establish a common language between everyone involved in the development process, especially between developers and users.
howTo: >-
  The output of the Ubiquitous Language practice should be a glossary of terms &
  concepts and their definitions. Ideally this glossary should be available for
  reading & reviewing by everyone involved in the development process, not only
  the developers. A git repository where changes can be tracked and suggested
  could be an ideal place for it.


  D﻿on't be afraid of drawing rather than writting. There might be concepts that are better explained in a diagram than in plain words.


  I﻿n order to start developing an Ubiquitous Language:


  1. S﻿tart collecting domain concepts from other practices. [Event Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/) is the perfect candidate practice to start capturing concepts that are relevant for the business domain but n﻿ot equally understood by all the participants of the Event Storming. D﻿on't limit yourself to the Event Storming, other discovery practices like [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/) or [Empathy Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/empathy-mapping/) are good candidates as well.

  2. D﻿evelop definitions for those concepts. 

  3. Validate those with the development team, the users, the PO, etc. Ask for feedback.

  4. I﻿terate ;)
