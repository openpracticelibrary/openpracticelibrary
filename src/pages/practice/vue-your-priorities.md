whatIs: T﻿his is a great way to p﻿rioritise a backlog or ToDo list by
  identifying the value, urgency, and effort associated with each item, and
  spark meaningful team conversations.
whyDo: D﻿eveloped by [John Cutle](https://cutlefish.substack.com/)﻿s an
  extension of Joshua Arnold's workshop about [Cost of
  Delay](https://www.infoq.com/news/2015/02/cost-of-delay/), this practice
  allows teams to tap into different perspectives, and make them explicit and
  intentional in order to drive prioritisation.
howTo: >-
  S﻿tep 0 - M﻿ake a list


  S﻿tep 1 - S﻿ort the list by Urgency - Does this need to be done ASAP? Soon? Whenever?


  S﻿tep 2 -  N﻿ext sort by Value - Will this be a game changer? a bonus? or meh?


  S﻿tep 3 - Consider the rate of value lost over time (Cost of Delay)


  S﻿tep 4 - N﻿ow filter by effort required as duration - a few days? a few weeks? a few months?


  S﻿tep 5 - Reveal the weighted cost of delay (CD3), discuss, and adjust.
