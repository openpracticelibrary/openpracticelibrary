  T﻿he Experiment Canvas, created by Chris Stone, is a practice and artifact
  that helps teams design focused experiments with clear guardrails around
  scope, involvement, timeframe, and success criteria. It's a great tool to use
  when a team has:


  a﻿) a problem they want to solve


  b﻿) an idea they want to implement


  I﻿f you get the sense the team doesn't have quite enough of a firm grasp of the problem, you might try running something like
whyDo: When a team fills out an experiment canvas together, it forces
  conversations that require the team to make decisions about specific areas
  that make up a well-designed experiment. By the end, all teams members have a
  clear sense of what's being done, thereby improving alignment, clarity, and
  speed while instilling a culture of ideation, collaboration, and
  experimentation as the vehicle to continuous improvement 💡 👩‍🔬 📈 🥳
howTo: >-
  1) P﻿repare a blank Experiment Canvas on a wall or in your digital
  whiteboarding tool of choice
  ([Miro](https://miro.com/miroverse/the-experiment-canvas/?social=copy-link),
  Mural, Jamboard, etc).


  W﻿ith the team, go through each section of the canvas 1 by 1 and fill in the required information, one idea per stickie.


  Y﻿ou can use the following recommended order to fill out the canvas, but it's not required:


  **1﻿. The Problem**\

  What problem are we trying to solve?\

  Why do we need to experiment with something new?


  T﻿ips: 


  * If the team already has a problem statement, insert it here. If they have multiple, have the team list all problem statements, then do a quick voting session to prioritize them and focus on the top-voted problem.

  * I﻿f the team is struggling to articulate the problem, it might be helpful to run an [Abstraction Ladder](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/abstraction-ladder/) activity to help them map out the full context of the problem space first. If you choose to do this, take the top problem the team votes on at the end of the Abstraction Ladder and insert it into this portion of the Experiment Canvas.


  **2﻿. The People**\

  W﻿ho will be affected by our experiment? (Who experiences our problem statement?)\

  W﻿ho do we need to engage and involve?


  T﻿ips:


  * Ask the question to the team and just have a group conversation. Capture ideas mentioned, 1 per stickie, then when ideas have stopped, playback what's captured with the team.

  * D﻿on't focus on the core team members yet - that comes in "The Scientists" section. This section should focus more on beneficiaries and people you may have to make aware that this experiment is happening or even occasionally collaborate with while the experiment runs....but the people in this section shouldn't be assigned to this experiment full-time. That's who The Scientists are.....we'll get to that section later!


  **3﻿. The Outcome**\

  W﻿hat are our desired outcomes?\

  W﻿hat are we hoping to achieve through the experiment?


  T﻿ips:


  * A﻿nother group conversation.

  * A﻿im for 3-5 outcomes. If there are more, have the team vote on the top 3-5 to bring focus.


  **4﻿. The Hypothesis**\

  W﻿hat's our hypothesis?


  T﻿ips:


  * T﻿his section will likely take the longest, but it's very important!

  * T﻿he facilitator will lead the discussion, creating stickies, then opening up to the team for discussion. With smaller groups, you can have the team start ideating as you capture ideas. For larger groups, or groups getting a bit stuck, you can facilitate this by nominating options and using your idea(s) as a starting point for the group to discuss.

  * IF

    * r﻿eword the problem statement as if it were accomplished
  * B﻿Y

    * e﻿xplain the solution (if the team doesn't have a clear solution in mind, you might consider running a "How Might We..." practice to generate and vote on ideas)
