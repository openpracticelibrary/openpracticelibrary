  T﻿his practice invites participants to collectively create an "Open Leadership
  Persona" that reflects the mindset, challenges, behaviors, and strengths of an
  open leader. The objective is to create a collective understanding of what it
  means to embody the five characteristics of open leadership 


  1. transparency

  2. inclusivity

  3. community

  4. collaboration

  5. adaptability


  Through group collaboration, participants jointly construct a persona that encapsulates an open leader's mindset, challenges they might face, behaviours they exhibit, and outline their strengths.


  By reflecting on each of the five characteristics, and developing a persona, participants collaboratively develop a clear understanding of what it means to embody these traits. 


  The exercise aims to empower participants to apply these principles in their leadership roles, fostering a culture of inclusivity, collaboration, and continuous improvement within their organisation. This will help them to drive positive change and nurture a more transparent and collaborative work environment.
whyDo: >-
  The "Open Leadership Persona Practice" is conducted for several important
  reasons:


  1. Create a Shared Understanding: By collaboratively developing the "Open Leadership Persona," participants contribute to a shared understanding of what it means to be an open leader. This shared vision promotes alignment and consistency in leadership practices within the organization.

  2. Encourage Application of Open Leadership Principles: The exercise empowers participants to apply the principles of open leadership in their own leadership roles. By creating a persona that embodies these traits, participants are inspired to emulate open leadership behaviors and foster a more inclusive and collaborative work environment.

  3. Foster Collaborative Problem-Solving: Through group discussions and brainstorming, the exercise encourages collaborative problem-solving. Participants work together to identify challenges and potential solutions, leveraging diverse perspectives for more comprehensive and innovative outcomes.

  4. Strengthen Organizational Culture: The exercise promotes the integration of open leadership principles into the organization's culture. It emphasizes transparency, inclusivity, and collaboration as essential values, contributing to a more positive and cohesive work environment.

  5. Empower Participants: By actively involving participants in the creation of the "Open Leadership Persona," the exercise empowers them to take ownership of open leadership principles. Participants feel more accountable for implementing positive changes in their leadership styles and team dynamics.

  6. Drive Continuous Improvement: The exercise reinforces the idea of continuous improvement. As participants identify challenges and behaviors, they are encouraged to seek opportunities for growth and adaptability in their leadership roles.

  7. Inspire Positive Change: Through the creation of actionable personas, the exercise inspires participants to take concrete steps towards becoming open leaders. It motivates them to lead with transparency, empathy, and inclusivity, ultimately driving positive change within the organization.
