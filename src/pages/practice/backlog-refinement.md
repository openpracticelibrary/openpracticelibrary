  ### How often should it occur and for how long?


  * The simple answer is as often as is necessary

  * Typically its advised that 1 hour of refinement should suffice for each week of the sprint


  ### Tips for Remote Working


  * This is perhaps the one of the most difficult to do remotely to keep the team engaged, especially if there hasn‚Äôt been a proper preparation by the Product Owner and Engagement Lead.

  * Ensure the Product Owner is prepared and has the necessary details and research done prior to the group getting together.

  * You can rotate role for leading the sessions to increase the team engagement with less passive behaviours and reduce tiredness on a single person acting as lead.

  * Organise multiple small sessions instead of a single long one for remote refinement, otherwise the session becomes tedious and people lose focus.

  * Use the virtual tools available to make as interactive as possible.

  * Use online tools to share the product backlog.

  * Share definition of done and ready with the team and keep them on display during the meeting.


  ### Advice


  * Although typically occurring as a team meeting, backlog refinement can occur throughout the sprint with the required parties. However information gained in this meeting must be adequately radiated to those who need it.

  * Product owners are also not necessarily required for a backlog refinement. The key is to have those who have sufficient knowledge to talk through a backlog item and answer questions. This may come in the form of a Product owner, Stakeholder, Developer etc
