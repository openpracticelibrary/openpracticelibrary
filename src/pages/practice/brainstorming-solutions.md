title: Brainstorming Solutions
subtitle: ' The objective of the Brainstorming Solutions Exercise is to
  collectively address the top three crucial challenges identified during the
  "Team: Tracing the Evolution of Teams" exercise for Open Leadership workshop.
  Through a structured process of brainstorming, clustering, and refining ideas,
  participants are encouraged to generate creative and actionable solutions for
  each challenge. The exercise fosters inclusivity by involving all participants
  in the problem-solving process, leveraging diverse perspectives to find
  innovative ways to improve team dynamics and collaboration. By shortlisting
  feasible solutions and defining clear action plans, the exercise aims to
  empower participants to take ownership and commitment towards implementing
  positive changes within their teams and the broader organization. Ultimately,
  the exercise facilitates a collaborative and open organizational culture,
  where inclusive problem-solving leads to practical and impactful solutions
  that benefit the entire organization.'

  This practice is the next step after HMW for Open Leadership Workshop.


  It is a collaborative practice and inclusive problem-solving exercise that aims to address crucial challenges faced by teams within an organization. Participants identify and prioritize key problems, brainstorm creative solutions, and refine them to create actionable plans. The exercise empowers individuals to take ownership and fosters a culture of continuous improvement within the organization

  This practise is conducted to address specific challenges or problems that
  have been identified during the "Building Bridges: Tracing the Evolution of
  Teams" exercise. The purpose of this exercise is multi-fold:


  1. Identify Crucial Problems: By shortlisting and prioritizing the top three important or crucial problems faced by teams during their evolution, the exercise helps focus the participants' attention on the most significant issues that require resolution.

  2. Encourage Collaborative Problem-Solving: The exercise fosters inclusivity by involving all participants in generating potential solutions. By leveraging diverse perspectives and ideas, the group can arrive at creative and innovative solutions that might not have been apparent in individual discussions.

  3. Enhance Teamwork and Collaboration: Through collaborative brainstorming, participants work together to address challenges faced by different teams within the organization. This process promotes a sense of interconnectedness and fosters a culture of cooperation and mutual support.

  4. Streamline and Refine Solutions: The clustering and refining steps help consolidate similar ideas, ensuring that the most promising and feasible solutions are considered for implementation. This helps avoid duplication of efforts and provides a more focused approach.

  5. Empower Ownership and Commitment: By involving participants in defining action plans ("Who does what by when"), the exercise empowers them to take ownership of specific tasks and be accountable for implementing the proposed solutions. This commitment is crucial for successful implementation.

  6. Promote Actionable Change: The exercise ensures that the solutions generated are actionable and practical. It moves beyond merely identifying problems to developing concrete steps that can be taken to drive positive change within the organization.

  7. Strengthen Organizational Culture: Emphasizing inclusivity and collaborative problem-solving promotes a culture of openness, trust, and respect within the organization. It encourages individuals to engage actively, share their perspectives, and contribute to the collective growth and success of the organization.

  8. Drive Continuous Improvement: By encouraging participants to reflect on challenges and work together to find solutions, the exercise supports a culture of continuous improvement. It instills a mindset that embraces change and seeks better ways of working and collaborating.


  Overall, the exercise is a valuable tool for enhancing team dynamics, fostering collaboration, and empowering participants to contribute to the organization's growth and success. It aligns with the principles of an open organization, where inclusivity and collective problem-solving lead to better decision-making and sustainable improvements.
howTo: >-
  **Step 1: Select Top Three HMW Statements**


  1. Begin by displaying all the "How Might We" (HMW) statements generated in the previous exercise.

  2. Provide each participant with a set of sticky dots (or any other voting method) and ask them to individually select their top three HMW statements by placing dots next to them.

  3. Identify the three HMW statements that received the most votes, as these will be the focus of the brainstorming session.


  **Step 2: Create a Visual Canvas for Chosen HMWs**


  1. Set up a canvas or a large flip chart and write down the three chosen HMW statements at the top, leaving enough space underneath each one.

  2. Make sure the canvas is visible to all participants.


  **Step 3: Brainstorming Ideas**


  1. Set a timer for 5 minutes and invite all participants to brainstorm potential solutions for each of the three HMW statements.

  2. Encourage participants to write down their ideas on sticky notes and place them under the relevant HMW statement on the canvas.

  3. Emphasize that all ideas are welcome and that participants should focus on generating as many creative solutions as possible.


  **Step 4: Clustering Solutions**


  1. After the brainstorming session, group similar or related ideas together on the canvas. Use different colored markers or lines to connect related sticky notes.

  2. Facilitate a discussion during this step to ensure that all participants understand the logic behind the clustering.


  **Step 5: Refining Solutions**


  1. Encourage participants to review the clusters and identify any duplicate or redundant ideas.

  2. Discuss and merge similar solutions to refine and streamline the list of potential solutions.


  **Step 6: Making Solutions Actionable**


  1. Begin the concluding step by shortlisting 2 or 3 practical and feasible solutions from each HMW cluster.

  2. Encourage the participants to consider the potential impact and ease of implementation for each shortlisted solution.

  3. For each selected solution, guide participants through the "Who does what by when" exercise:

     * Identify the key stakeholders responsible for implementing the solution (Who).
     * Outline specific actions or tasks that need to be performed to implement the solution (What).
     * Set clear deadlines or timelines for each task (When).
     * Optionally, consider any additional important steps or resources required to execute the solution.

  **Step 7: Discussion and Commitment**


  1. Facilitate a group discussion to present the shortlisted solutions and their respective action plans.

  2. Encourage participants to provide feedback, offer suggestions for improvement, and openly discuss any potential challenges or barriers to implementation.

  3. Seek commitment from participants to take ownership of specific action items and hold themselves accountable for their roles in bringing the solutions to life.


  **Step 8: Concluding Remarks**


  1. Thank all participants for their active engagement in the brainstorming solutions exercise.

  2. Highlight the importance of collective problem-solving and the potential positive impact that these actionable solutions can have on team development and organizational success.

  3. Reinforce the value of inclusive decision-making and the power of collaboration in driving meaningful change within the organization.

    description: What Is Lightning Decision Jam? This is a workshop exercise that
      you can use for almost anything. Created by the amazing team at AJ&Smart,
      the Lightning Decision Jam involves getting a few people in a room to
      define and solve challenges. It is a handful of practices you run with a
      group to identify pain points or problems to solve, to prioritize those
      problems, to ideate solutions to the most important problems, and to
      prioritize those solutions. Finally, you assign next steps for the team to
      take in order to run a solution experiment.
