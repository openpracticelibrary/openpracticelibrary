  Heuristic evaluation is a method for reviewing designs based on ten basic
  principles. The term was [coined by Jakob
  Neilsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) back in
  1995, but the principles are still just as relevant today.
whyDo: >-
  - Provide expert review of designs, which can be a great companion to feedback
  from usability testing.

  - It can be difficult to provide useful design critiques. These heuristics
  help reviewers provide concrete, actionable feedback.
howTo: >-
  1. Establish an appropriate list of heuristics. Use Nielsen and Molich's 10
  heuristics and Ben Shneiderman’s 8 golden rules as inspiration and stepping
  stone. Make sure to combine them with other relevant design guidelines and
  market research.


  2. Select your evaluators. Make sure to carefully choose your evaluators. Your
  evaluators should not be your end users. They should typically be usability
  experts and preferably with domain expertise in the industry type that your
  product is in. For example, an evaluator investigating a Point-of-Sale system
  for the restaurant industry should have at least a general understanding of
  restaurant operations.


  3. Brief your evaluators so they know exactly what they are meant to do and
  cover during their evaluation. The briefing session should be standardized to
  ensure the evaluators receive the same instructions; otherwise you may bias
  their evaluation. Within this brief, you may wish to ask the evaluators to
  focus on a selection of tasks, but sometimes they may state which tasks they
  will cover on the basis of their experience and expertise.


  4. First evaluation phase. The first evaluation generally takes around two
  hours, depending on the nature and complexity of your product. The evaluators
  will use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and
  the scope. They will then identify specific elements that they want to
  evaluate.


  5. Second evaluation phase. In the second evaluation phase, the evaluators
  will carry out another run-through, whilst applying the chosen heuristics to
  the elements identified during the first phase. The evaluators would focus on
  individual elements and look at how well they fit in the overall design.


  6. Record problems. The evaluators must either record problems themselves or
  you should record them as they carry out their various tasks to track any
  problems they encounter. Be sure to ask the evaluators to be as detailed and
  specific as possible when recording problems.


  7. Debriefing session. The debriefing session involves collaboration between
  the different evaluators to collate their findings and establish a complete
  list of problems. They should then be encouraged to suggest potential
  solutions for these problems on the basis of the heuristics.

## What is it?
Heuristic evaluation is a method for reviewing designs based on ten basic principles. The term was [coined by Jakob Neilsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) back in 1995, but the principles are still just as relevant today.

## Why use it?
- Provide expert review of designs, which can be a great companion to feedback from usability testing.
- It can be difficult to provide useful design critiques. These heuristics help reviewers provide concrete, actionable feedback.
