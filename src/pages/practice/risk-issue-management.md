whatIs: To help the team identifying and evaluating risks (potential issues) and
  finding actions to avoid or minimise their impact on time, cost and or scope.
whyDo: It will reduce the likelihood of the event to happen and reduce the
  magnitude of its impact
howTo: >-
  * The best approach to identifying risks is to arrange a workshop where the
  participants will brainstorm on potential, future risks

  * First, risks needs to be identified which can have an impact to the project or outcome

  * Some example of risks are:
    * Inadequate delivery capability (due to team experience, lack of inconsistent methodology or process)
    * Ineffective delivery (due to unclear roles & responsibilities, issues not being escalated)
    * Inadequate management of stakeholders (due to expectations not being identified)
    * Unclear project or activity value (due to poor evaluation of business ownership of benefits)
    * Resource limitations (due to skill shortages)
    * Failure to recognise & manage dependencies (due to lack of communication)
    * Failure of external vendors / suppliers (due to poor engagement)
  * Next, the risks need to be rated based on likelihood and impact at the present time

  * Once the risks have been rated, mitigation strategies need to identified.

  * Last but not least, the risks will be displayed in the team area, where the Daily Standup's happen. That way, the risks can be reviewed on a daily basis and dealt with, if / once they occur.
