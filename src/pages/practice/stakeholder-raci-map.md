  A Stakeholder RACI Map is a diagram that helps to show the roles and
  responsibilities of the people involved with a project or initiative. The word
  "RACI" is an acronym for four types of stakeholder involvement:


  * R (Responsible) – Responsible for performing the activity for their execution. (Core Team)

  * A (Accountable) – The person with the final say and the decision maker. 

  * C (Consulted) – A stakeholder who needs to be consulted prior to decisions or actions. (Support Team)

  * I (Informed) – People who need to be informed of progress and results.


  This mapping also makes it obvious who is doing what. It prevents confusion and enhances collaboration in the project.

  Making a Stakeholder RACI Map is important to keep the project on track and running smoothly. Its main advantages are:


  * Removing ambiguity – It clearly shows who is accountable for doing what.

  * Better communication – Enables people to communicate, so everyone knows how involved they are.

  * Enhancing efficiency – Minimizes conflicts and redundancies by establishing well-defined roles.

  * Enabling governance – Facilitates decision-making through effective dispensation of authority.

  * Facilitating involvement – Involves people in a clear plan, making them take part effectively.

  To create a Stakeholder RACI Map, follow these steps:


  ### Facilitation Materials Needed


  Before starting, gather facilitation material as needed:


  * Templates can be paper-based, whiteboard, or computer-based software like Miro, MURAL, Trello, and Excel.

  * Stakeholders and project activities list.

  * Markers or sticky notes to mark RACI categories.

  * Video conferencing software, if working remotely (Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet, etc.).


  ### Preparation


  * Identify key people – List all the groups connected with the project.

  * Define key activities – Describe the most important tasks and decisions that must be defined.

  * Choose a documentation tool – It may be a spreadsheet, an online board, or even hard copy.

  * Invite stakeholders – Ensure all interested individuals are aware of the process and its importance.


  ### Execution


  * Construct the Matrix – Create a table with stakeholders as the title and activities as column one.

  * Assign roles – For each activity, identify who will be Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

  * Review with the team – Review the map with key individuals to make sure duties are understood.

  * Adjust and refine – As required, amend overlaps or gaps.


  ### Tips for Remote Working


  If the facilitation is done online, keep the following in mind:


  * Use collaborative tools – Tools like Miro and MURAL allow for concurrent visualization and editing.

  * Break facilitation into steps – Split the workshop into smaller sections to keep everybody engaged.

  * Establish interaction rules – Teach the participants how to communicate and give feedback in the session.


  Document decisions or record the meeting – Helps in having a clear record of tasks and justifications. The Stakeholder RACI Map assists in making us better at managing people on a project. It ensures everyone is aware of what they need to do on the project. Utilizing this structured approach, implementing this map can significantly increase team efficiency and success!
