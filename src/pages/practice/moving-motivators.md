  ### Steps


  * First, download and print the cards that you will find on the [Management 3.0 website](https://management30.com/practice/moving-motivators/). You can also buy sets of cards if you prefer.

    * Once you have the cards, play the game alone. That is your training.
  * Sort the cards from left to right. The most important motivation factor is on the left; the less important is on the right.

  * Consider a change in your life and how this change affects your motivation factors. Move the card up if it is a positive effect and down if it is a negative effect.

  * Consider the transformation you would like your team to commit to and look at how it affects your motivators.
