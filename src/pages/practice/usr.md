  1. Good Ideas


  > Anyone who comes up with a good idea is awarded the Unicorn.  Anyone can award the Unicorn to others and there is no limit to the number of times you can be awarded the Unicorn.  If you are awarded the Unicorn, you are given a +1 against your name on the board.
  

  2. Disruptive Behaviour
  

  > If someone is being disruptive to the meeting, being difficult or generally derailing the discussions then they are awarded the Skunk.  Like the Unicorn, anyone can award the Skunk to others and there is no limit to the number of times you can be awarded the Skunk.  If you are awarded the Skunk, you are given -3 against your name on the board.
  

  3. Rat Holing
  

  > If someone leads the conversation down a 'rat hole', then they are awarded the Rat.  Like the Unicorn and the Skunk, anyone can award the Rat to others and there is no limit to the number of times you can be awarded the Rat.  If you are awarded the Rat, you are given -1 against your name on the board.
  
  
  At the end of the meeting/workshop the points are added up, deducted and the person with the most points is awarded a prize.  The prize can vary based on the organisation e.g. award points, the actual unicorn or something else.
