whatIs: I﻿t is a visual mapping tool that is centred around people.
whyDo: By mapping out the organisation/hierarchy as a group activity, the group
  naturally shares with one another opinions and biases, which creates
  opportunities to learn from one another as well as the target of the activity.
howTo: >-
  1. P﻿repare a whiteboard or virtual canvas to work on

  2. E﻿nsure each participant has writing materials with at least 3 different colours.

  3. S﻿tart with asking the group to describe the goals of the target company / group, be sure it is written in the words of the contributor, allow perceptions and assumptions as well. List them down and add to the canvas.

  4. R﻿epeat step #3 with constraints, what are the constraints acting upon this company / group, list them down and add to the canvas.

  5. T﻿imebox this next activity, ask the team to draw up the organisational hierarchy or relationship map, using lines and words, map out names of people, role titles and "what they mean to us". Encourage them to share their opinions while they do so.
