howTo: The tests and build steps are typically run in an automation server such
  as  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) or [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/). There
  are also cloud native/kubernetes solutions such as
  [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/).

whatIs: With Continuous Integration (CI), developers submit small, frequent
  changes instead of large, infrequent changes. When another developer accepts
  the changes, automated tests and build steps run to ensure that the code works
  as expected. This action is completed frequently, many times a day with
  automation running each time thus insuring the code base can _Continuously
  Integrate._
whyDo: >-
  * Automated testing reduces busy work and improves software quality. 

  * Small, regular code commits reduce the number of integration problems. 

  * Rapid feedback loops make it easier for new contributors to get started. 

  * It's fun! Shipping of functional software in small increments is more enjoyable than waiting for someone to manually test a giant code change.

# Why use it?

* Automated testing reduces busy work and improves software quality.
* Small, regular code commits reduce the number of integration problems.
* Rapid feedback loops make it easier for new contributors to get started.
* It's fun! Shipping of functional software in small increments is more enjoyable than waiting for someone to manually test a giant code change.
