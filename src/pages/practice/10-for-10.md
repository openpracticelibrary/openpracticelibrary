  Brainstorming Workshop. There are literally billions of Brainstorming workshop
  styles out there you can choose from… But, many of them are completely broken
  because of one big thing: They end up being big, messy discussions where the
  loudest person wins... or where the boss wins. This is because many
  Brainstorming techniques don't take human-nature, implied hierarchies or even

  All you have to do as the facilitator of a 10 for 10 session is turn the topic
  you want to Brainstorm into a "How Might We" phrased challenge. This is very
  simple. Essentially you are rephrasing whatever challenge or topic you have
  into something that is actionable!

  Is there something you've been stuck on? Why don't you take it for a test run? Try it out with your team or client! It only takes 10 minutes to see how powerful something like this can be in practice!


  S﻿o the steps are:


  1. S﻿et the challenge to the participants

  2. G﻿ive people 5 minutes to create as many ideas as possible

  3. G﻿ive people 1 minutes to select their top 10 ideas, discard the rest

  4. L﻿et each participant stick their top 10 ideas on a white board or wall

  5. Read out all the sticky notes to the room, remove duplicates

  6. G﻿ive people 10 votes in the form of sticky dots

  7. G﻿ive the participants 3 minutes to vote (ie stick sticky dots on sticky notes)

  8. Re-order the sticky notes by votes

  9. V﻿oila! You are done!

# What is it?

One of the most common types of workshops that every designer, PM or consultant will have to run in their lives is the plain and simple Brainstorming Workshop. There are literally billions of Brainstorming workshop styles out there you can choose from… But, many of them are completely broken because of one big thing: They end up being big, messy discussions where the loudest person wins... or where the boss wins. This is because many Brainstorming techniques don't take human-nature, implied hierarchies or even varied personalities into consideration.

The 10 for 10 workshop helps teams to think quickly and objectively and be focussed with their prioritisation. It's lightweight, fun and super useful! The only thing you need to start a 10 for 10 session is a topic.
