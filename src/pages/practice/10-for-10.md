  One of the most common types of workshops that every designer, PM or
  consultant will have to run in their lives is the plain and simple
  Brainstorming Workshop. There are literally billions of Brainstorming workshop
  styles out there you can choose from… But, many of them are completely broken
  because of one big thing: They end up being big, messy discussions where the
  loudest person wins... or where the boss wins. This is because many
  Brainstorming techniques don't take human-nature, implied hierarchies or even
  varied personalities into consideration.

  The 10 for 10 workshop helps teams to think quickly and objectively and be
  focussed with their prioritisation. It's lightweight, fun and super useful!
  The only thing you need to start a 10 for 10 session is a topic. Since you can
  use this method to brainstorm almost anything, there are very few limitations,
  still, it's always better to give some examples:

  * Generating ideas for a company event

  * Generating ideas for new features for an app

  * Generating headline ideas for a new landing page

  * Generating ideas to improve your office environment

  All you have to do as the facilitator of a 10 for 10 session is turn the topic
  you want to Brainstorm into a "How Might We" phrased challenge. This is very
  simple. Essentially you are rephrasing whatever challenge or topic you have
  into something that is actionable!
