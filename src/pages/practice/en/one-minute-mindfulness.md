  We live in a fast paced world. We can all benefit from incorporating stress
  reduction into our daily routine in order to nurture and encourage our
  well-being. Having just sixty seconds of mindful breathing exercise per day
  may boost our physical and mental energy. One minute mindfulness is a
  micro-habit to develop an empathetic mindset. It can be easily integrated into
  scrum practices, we already have time and place for it at every start of daily
  stand-ups.
