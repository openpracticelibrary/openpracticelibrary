  [TheDesignExchange.org](https://thedesignexchange.org) put together a really
  great video quickly describing the AEIOU Observation Framework in less than
  one minute, so please take a look by clicking the image below:

  [![AEIOU, The Design Exchange
  Video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uvvd6pcNX84/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvvd6pcNX84)

  That video says it all but for reference AEIOU stands for:

  > **A - Activities**


  > **E - Environments**


  > **I - Interactions**


  > **O - Objects**


  > **U - Users**


  This heuristic framework provides an observation technique used to document
  contextual inquiries during ethnographic studies. For the purposes of digital
  product and software practices, AEIOU is helpful for categorizing and
  interpreting observations gathered during user research field studies and
  usability testing efforts.

  The acronym AEIOU provides an easy to recall mnemonic for how to observe
  qualitative research, it also quickly turns raw notes into categories that can
  inform research analysis to develop key insights and other findings.
whyDo: >-
  AEIOU relates to five heuristic categories to be observed and documented
  during user interviews, which provides a guideline for how to capture research
  data. This outline quickly defines each category:

  * **Activities:** What actions and behaviors are people taking to reach goals?


  * **Environments:** What is the overall setting in which the activities are
  taking place? How are people behaving in the environment?


  * **Interactions:** What are the basic interactions occurring for people to
  reach goals? What effect do people have on activities and environment?


  * **Objects:** What are all the details that form the environment? How do
  objects relate to people, activities and interactions?


  * **Users:** Who are the people being observed? What are their personalities
  like? How do they engage with other people to reach goals?


  AEIOU is a starting point for research efforts, the above category definitions
  can be iterated upon and refined to align with project goals. [Rick E.
  Robinson](https://www.epicpeople.org/building-a-useful-research-tool/),
  creator of AEIOU, calls it a “categorizing heuristic” which can be modified.

  ## How to conduct a contextual inquiry using AEIOU?

  AEIOU provides a template for observing contextual inquiries and collecting
  qualitative data. Simply use the framework to create a worksheet which can be
  taken in the field for researchers to utilize. It will help gather
  observational data in addition to other ethnographic methods such as audio,
  photos and video.

  The worksheet design can be a simple word processing document with added space
  to take notes in each section, or organized with columns similar to a
  spreadsheet like this example:

  ![AEIOU Column Worksheet ](/images/aeiou_worksheet.jpg)

  The worksheet can also be designed in a fun way like this empathy map example:

  ![AEIOU Empathy Map
  https://www.creatlr.com/template/1knjaTEkdFHvtBOLr8DAx/aeiou-empathy-map/](/images/aeiou-empathy-map.png)

  ## How to use AEIOU as a methodology?

  While AEIOU was not necessarily created to inform methodology it can also
  provide a guideline for conducting user research.

  Sometimes with exploratory studies that have lengthy technically specific
  discussion guides, the data collection is often broad and later analysis will
  define the categories of information. In this case, AEIOU can be used as a
  method for aligning a team upon the heuristic observation strategy and
  planning research data collection.

  **PRO TIP:** Include a section on the discussion guide cover page with a quick
  overview of what to look for. This is a helpful reminder for observers and
  note takers about responsibilities during a user interview session. These
  bullets are a good example of what to include and can be modified or added to
  for alignment with project goals:

  * AEIOU Framework (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users) *
  Capture what you see (participant’s body language, artifacts used, etc.) *
  Capture what you hear in their words (quotes, stories, keywords,
  contradictions, etc.) * Capture what you feel that the user is feeling
  (emotions, beliefs, confusion, passion, etc.)

  ## Facilitation Notes

  **Prerequisite Knowledge**


  Some idea of the research goals is helpful.


  **Deliverable**


  The worksheets will be used to include in research analysis activities.
