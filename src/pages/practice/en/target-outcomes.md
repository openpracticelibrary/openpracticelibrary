  * A tool to capture and articulate the goals and outcomes a team are striving
  to deliver.

whyDo: >-
  * Helps achieve alignment and focus across stakeholder groups and team
  members.


  * Helps focus on achieving measurable customer and business outcomes / impacts as opposed to purely outputs.


  * Provides a visual reminder to all on the current outcomes of focus and can be used to help with prioritisation / filtering of upcoming work items.
howTo: >-
  * Prepare in advance a template on a whiteboard tool with title and steps and
  be crystal clear about what you expect providing examples

  * Use the timer visible to all attendees

  * Start with the [Start At The End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/) practice and apply the [Affinity Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/affinity-mapping/) practice to group topics

  * At the end you can review the Target Outcomes of your initiative and write a SMART GOAL that can become the starting point of Impact Map or the Open Decision Tree


  ### Tips for Remote Working


  * Remote facilitation doesnâ€™t differ much from the face to face, but you need to be more clear on the preparation of the draft Target outcome prepared before the working session is starting, by your Product Owner
