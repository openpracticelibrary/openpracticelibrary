whatIs: >-
  * Lean Coffee started in Seattle in 2009 by Jim Benson and Jeremy Lightsmith

  * A structured, but agenda-less meeting.  Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking.

  * Intentionally minimalist - to be the least structure necessary for a coherent and productive meeting
whyDo: |-
  * Surfaces topics that the participants want to discuss
  * Helps create more value out the of conversation since it's participant-run
  * For meetings with a specific focus, add scope to the discussion topics
howTo: >-
  ### Materials Needed

  * Writing utensils for all participants (markers are easier to read from a distance)

  * Sticky notes (any medium size: 3x3, 4x6, etc)

  * Time keeping device

  * Wall surface or table

  ### How to use it

  * Set up a Personal Kanban with three columns:
    * To Discuss
    * Discussing
    * Discussed

  * What to discuss
    * Ask each person to write down topics they would like to talk about on separate sticky notes.  Time-box to a few minutes, ideally 3-5.
    * Lay out the topics and group duplicates or similar discussion points

  * Vote & talk
    * Use Dot Voting to prioritize the topics
    * Start the timer and move the highest priority topic to the "Discussing" column.  Have a volunteer start the conversation.
    * At the end of a set time-box, ask the group if they want to keep talking about that topic or move on to the next by asking for a visual indicator, where:
      * Thumbs up = "keep talking about this topic"
      * Thumbs sideways = "no strong opinion either way"
      * Thumbs down = "end discussion and switch to next topic"
    * Keep updating the Kanban board.  Continue this until you are out of time or out of topics.
