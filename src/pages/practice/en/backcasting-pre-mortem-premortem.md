  Premortem is an analytical / thought experiment technique, which is frequently
  used for risk management, strategic or product decision evaluation.


  To apply it a group of people is brought together to a meeting. In that
  meeting, almost as a game, people have to imagine a point in the future where
  the project has drastically failed and think up different reasons why that
  might have happened.


  The method originates from Gary Klein (HBR article) and was made popular by
  the Nobel price winner Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow”.


  The approach is really simple and transports the team in the distant future in
  which the product would be launched and failed miserably. The team is asked to
  describe the reasons, the root causes really, behind the notorious failure.


  The practice is very similar to the black hat in the Six Thinking Hats
  brainstorming approach or the [News
  Headlines](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/news-headlines-aka-cover-story/).
  The News Headlines is a really a variation of the premortem practice using
  visual facilitation.
whyDo: >-
  The method is simple, fast and cheap to execute. You do not need to prime the
  group or invest in any upfront training.


  It is a great way to identify risks and threats, which can be later addressed,
  e.g. through early experiments or other actions.


  The benefits of this method when making important product decisions:


  * Eliminates groupthink


  * Overcomes blind spots - as planning far ahead tends to introduce risks of
  overlooking details


  * A psychologically safe way to surface disagreements on important details of
  the product design - often in lack of psychological safety, people would not
  point out gaps or deficiencies in the design to avoid appearing as pessimists
  or getting in a debate over the relevance of their concerns
