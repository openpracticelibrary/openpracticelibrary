  Emotional Journey is a powerful research practice to **identify and visualize
  how users feel** at each stage of the experience while they are using a
  product or service.


  Mapping these metrics help the team to **understand, test and** **deliver a positive experience for the users**.


  The emotions of the user can be captured by dots, emojis, pictures, colours, curves or other forms and shapes that **represent the level of sentiment** from each moment of the journey.


  The Emotional Journey is usually used asan **add-on to a User Journey Map or [Service Blueprint](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/service-blueprint/)** practices.

howTo: >-
  

  1. Define what experience you want to map. [User Stories](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/user-story-mapping/) and [Prioritisation Matrix](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-effort-prioritization-matrix/) are useful practices that may help you to identify the user experience you want to address.

  2. Collect information from research and assumptions. It’s recommended to build a [Persona](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/proto-persona/) or/and [Empathy Map](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/empathy-mapping/) in order to visualise all the insights from the user perspective like their blockers, opportunities, needs, expectations, etc.

  3. If you identified more than one Personas then make sure you build an emotional journey for each of them because their journey and experience may be different.

  4. Start mapping the actions of the user during the journey in chronological order. It doesn’t have to be the entire journey, it may be just a part of it that you want to focus on during the experience.

  5. Use a line or curve graph to represent how the user feels during the journey.(↑Happy ↓Sad). It’s highly recommended to add a comment on what the user is feeling or thinking during the actions of the journey for a better understanding. You can add more than one comment per user action.

  6. Analyse the map and improve where it is needed based on the peaks and lows.


  ## Notes & Observations




  * There are many different ways to build an emotional journey depending on the approach and the quality of the research.

  * You can first build the Emotional Journey and then use it to make the User Journey Map with Touchpoints, Pain points, Opportunities etc. or you can create it based on an existing Journey Map. The order of the practices doesn’t affect the final result.

  * Adding an horizontal line in the middle of the Emotional Journey will help you to see faster where the opportunity is.

  * It’s recommended to have one Emotional Journey per user. In case you’re using it for a [Service Blueprint](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/service-blueprint/) where different actors are involved then you can use the same space to represent the Emotional Journey for each of them. If this is the case, remember to use dissimilar colours to represent the different actors. (See the following example)

    ![EmotionalJourneyServiceBlueprint](/images/service-blueprint-frame-6-1-.jpg "Emotional Journey with multiple actors")
  * Having the User Story/Scenario, the [Persona](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/proto-persona/) and his/her goal near the board helps to have a clear and common understanding of what the Emotional Journey is representing.

  * Emotional Journey can be used as a metric to compare As-is with To-be or Ideal User Journey experiences

  * It can also be used as a low fidelity experience prototype to test with users.
