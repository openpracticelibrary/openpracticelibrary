whatIs: This is a workshop exercise that you can use for **almost anything**.
  Created by the amazing team at [AJ&Smart](https://ajsmart.com/), the Lightning
  Decision Jam involves getting a few people in a room to define and solve
  challenges. It is a handful of practices you run with a group to identify pain
  points or problems to solve, to prioritize those problems, to ideate solutions
  to the most important problems, and to prioritize those solutions. Finally,
  you assign next steps for the team to take in order to run a solution
  experiment.

  The Lightning Decision Jam (LDJ) is an insanely flexible combination of

  to name a few) and crushing them down to their absolute essence. It is great
  to use if you feel like your team either is not currently focused on constant
  improvement OR you find the meetings you have about improving or problem
  solving never have any follow-through. Oh, or you are in a group where a small
  group of people tend to dominate the conversation! This helps to ensure
  **everyone**'s ideas are considered üëèüëèüëè


  The LDJ is awesome for helping the team find areas of improvement. It helps drive the conversation toward a clear experiment to discover a solution within a very short period of time. So if you want to have fast follow-through for your team, this is a great workshop to try out!
