  USR (Unicorn, Skunk, Rat) is a technique which can be applied to running
  meetings.  Everyone's name who are participating in the meeting/workshop is
  written up on a board.  The headings across the board are:

  * Unicorn

  * Skunk

  * Rat
howTo: >-
  During the meeting/workshop scores are awarded to individuals based on the
  following:


  1. Good Ideas


  > Anyone who comes up with a good idea is awarded the Unicorn.  Anyone can
  award the Unicorn to others and there is no limit to the number of times you
  can be awarded the Unicorn.  If you are awarded the Unicorn, you are given a
  +1 against your name on the board.


  2. Disruptive Behaviour


  > If someone is being disruptive to the meeting, being difficult or generally
  derailing the discussions then they are awarded the Skunk.  Like the Unicorn,
  anyone can award the Skunk to others and there is no limit to the number of
  times you can be awarded the Skunk.  If you are awarded the Skunk, you are
  given -3 against your name on the board.


  3. Rat Holing


  > If someone leads the conversation down a 'rat hole', then they are awarded
  the Rat.  Like the Unicorn and the Skunk, anyone can award the Rat to others
  and there is no limit to the number of times you can be awarded the Rat.  If
  you are awarded the Rat, you are given -1 against your name on the board.


  At the end of the meeting/workshop the points are added up, deducted and the
  person with the most points is awarded a prize.  The prize can vary based on
  the organisation e.g. award points, the actual unicorn or something else.
