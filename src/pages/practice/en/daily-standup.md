  * The main point of a daily standup (Daily Scrum) is for the team to better
  align towards the sprint goal * Teams get together to share transparently the
  ongoing work and highlight roadblocks/impediments they might be facing * It is
  a review of the things that were DONE and things we intend to get DONE. *
  Typically this is achieved by team members answering 3 questions

    1. What did you do yesterday?
    2. What will you do today?
    3. Do you have any blockers or impediments?
whyDo: "* Provides a quick touchpoint on what is going on with the team * Quick
  feedback on impediments and keep people honest and transparent * Focus on
  getting things done rather than what keeps us busy * It is a reinforcement of
  the goal and direction the team is after and a point of recharging the team
  with new energy for pursuing the goal"

  ### Advice

  * As mentioned above, the main point of a stand up is alignment. Be careful it doesn't drift into a status update, focus on what those around you need to know and park any conversations not relevant until the end.

  ### Tips for Remote Working

  * Cameras on and everyone contributes. * Use video conference tools. Everyone logs in separately - if a few people are co-located it can be difficult if that group is dialled in together. * Use an online visual timer to keep to the 15 minute timebox for stand-up. The core agenda is:
      1. What I did yesterday
      2. What I am doing today
      3. I have blockers

  * People tend to talk more for socialisation and for status updates, for this reason leave 5 minutes more at the end for these aspects that can be more relevant being distributed * Consider that the team may be distributed across multiple time zones so agree a time that is cognisant if this. * Collectively create a list of topics that need to be discussed after the standup, adding to a blockers board or in the parking lot.
