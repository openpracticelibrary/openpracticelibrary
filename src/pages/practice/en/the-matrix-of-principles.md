whyDo: >-
  Reflecting on the management principles enables the team to share their
  beliefs on management, to share their views on where the organization is, and
  to identify areas for improvement.
howTo: >-
  * Take a blank sheet of paper, or use a whiteboard.


  * Draw a 2x2 matrix.


  * The horizontal axis represents your agreement with the principle. On the
  right, you agree; on the left, you disagree.


  * The vertical axis represents how the principle is applied to your
  organization. "Applied" at the top, "not applied" at the bottom.


  * You will now position Deming's 14 Management Principles by placing their
  numbers on a 2x2 matrix. Each team member uses a different color.


  * After placing each principle, the facilitator asks the outliers to explain
  their position.


  * The facilitator asks the group if it inspires some ideas for the team.


  You can use the tool as a self-reflection one. As a facilitator, it is useful
  to try the exercise first by yourself to be able to pick the principles that
  will most resonate with your team.
