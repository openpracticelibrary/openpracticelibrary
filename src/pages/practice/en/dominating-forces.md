whatIs: >-
  This is a facilitated practice that communicates or validates existing or
  helps establish new strategies to reach the specified goal(s) while also
  taking into consideration detractors and challenges with regard to culture and
  execution. This practice surfaces risks and potential issues for any
  subsequent project, program, or product to be developed.


  Strategies should cover what we do and don't do and how we compete. And be clearly linked to the goals that the strategy supports.

  Culture should look at people, skills, communication, principles, and team structures/topologies.

  Execution should take into consideration processes, capabilities, tools, and metrics.


  If goals need to be established first then you can start off with 


  * [Start at the end](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/)


  If strategies are missing then start off with 


  * [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/)


  If there is no context of Mission, Vision, Goals, and strategies then it is recommended to start off with the practices around establishing a cohesive [Means to End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/means-to-end/) framework.
whyDo: >-
  The Why is to ensure strategy, culture and execution challenges (and bright
  spots) are clearly identified.


  This is where the rubber hits the road, marrying lofty goals and strategies with the reality of culture, people, communication, team structure, metrics, processes, and more.


  When goals and associated strategies are formulated this exercise allows for immediate 'reality checks' and surfaces potential challenges and roadblocks that must be paid attention to. This allows to plan for risk mitigation strategies right from the start or even before an engagement, project or program of works kicks off.
howTo: >-
  Once the goal(s) are agreed upon you can run a 10-for-10 exercise to bring out
  new strategies. If the strategies are already existing then the SME's need to
  present the existing strategies and the related goals those strategies are in
  support of.


  After the goals and strategies have been agreed upon the facilitator can allow between 3 - 7  minutes to flush out the challenges (and bright spots if necessary) in the execution and culture area.
