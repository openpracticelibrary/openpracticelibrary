  #### Functional Item


  “Between dogs and camels, all things are animals. You should avoid rats and
  Elephants” - Although there is variability in the size of the items, we avoid
  the extremes. A functional item generates value, each card on the board
  represents a delivery of value perceived by the business. if you want a dog,
  it’s leg, tail or head alone does not generate value.


  #### Replenishment


  Replenishment is the act of understanding and committing to demand. It is like
  a wedding - after the commitment point it is not desirable to give up the item
  (although it may happen ☹️ ). Kanban is a pull system - Frequent replenishment
  is more agile, on-demand replenishment is most agile!


  #### Kanban Meeting


  “Stop starting, start finishing!” iterates across the tickets from right
  (closest to completion) to left (most recently started). “Ask the cards, not
  the people” - What can we do to finish this job?


  #### Done/Demo


  At the end of the work, the team can demonstrate the result to the
  stakeholders. The team may decide to demonstrate on small batches of
  functionality of the same subject or on demand.


  #### Retrospectives


  Evaluate work output at regular intervals, analyze metrics and seek continuous
  improvement.


  #### WIP Limit


  Limit work in progress. These sample numbers represent the maximum number of
  functional items for workflow. Promote finishing and provoke important
  discussions. “Stop starting, start finishing!”


  #### One Way


  Do not move cards backwards. An item flows when work is completed at each
  step. If a correction needs to be made, keep the item in the same column,
  eventually signaling that a block exists. Focus on finishing.


  #### Metrics


  *Throughput* - The amount of items delivered in a given time frame, usually
  weeks.

  *Lead Time* - The clock starts ticking on replenishment and ends when the item
  is delivered.The number of calendar days to get an item done is the lead time.

  *CFD* - Cumulative Flow Diagram Shows demand, WIP, approximate average lead
  time and delivery rate capabilities.

  To collect these metrics you only need the start and finishing date for an
  item then count how many items you have per day in each column.


  #### Explicit Policies


  Post policies where you can see them. Policies are rules for how we work and
  should be developed collaboratively. Example - pull criteria, wip limits, date
  to deploy.


  #### SDM


  Service Delivery Manager is a suggested role to manage the flow. SDM manages
  blockers, collects metrics, and supports team for flow improvement.


  #### Class of Service


  Class of service is based on cost of delay and defines how this category of
  item is treated in the system. A “tiger on fire” (expedite) has higher
  priority than other animals (standard). The most common classes of services
  are standard, expedite, fixed-date and intangible.


  #### Extra


  #### *Blocker/Block Column*


  Do not have a column for blocked items. A block is a condition for an item in
  some column of workflow, not a part of the workflow.

## What is it?

A suggestion to explain and start with the Kanban Method.

## Why use it?

It's simple and it's a funny explanation.

## Explanation

**Functional Item**

“Between dogs and camels, all things are animals. You should avoid rats and Elephants” - Although there is variability in the size of the items, we avoid the extremes. A functional item generates value, each card on the board represents a delivery of value perceived by the business. if you want a dog, it’s leg, tail or head alone does not generate value.

**Replenishment**

Replenishment is the act of understanding and committing to demand. It is like a wedding - after the commitment point it is not desirable to give up the item (although it may happen :( ). Kanban is a pull system - Frequent replenishment is more agile, on-demand replenishment is most agile!

**Kanban Meeting**

“Stop starting, start finishing!” iterates across the tickets from right (closest to completion) to left (most recently started). “Ask the cards, not the people” - What can we do to finish this job?

**Done/Demo**

At the end of the work, the team can demonstrate the result to the stakeholders. The team may decide to demonstrate on small batches of functionality of the same subject or on demand.

**Retrospectives**

Evaluate work output at regular intervals, analyze metrics and seek continuous improvement.

**WIP Limit**

Limit work in progress. These sample numbers represent the maximum number of functional items for workflow. Promote finishing and provoke important discussions. “Stop starting, start finishing!”

**One Way**

Do not move cards backwards. An item flows when work is completed at each step. If a correction needs to be made, keep the item in the same column, eventually signaling that a block exists. Focus on finishing.

**Metrics**

_Throughput_ - The amount of items delivered in a given time frame, usually weeks.

_Lead Time_ - The clock starts ticking on replenishment and ends when the item is delivered.The number of calendar days to get an item done is the lead time.

_CFD_ - Cumulative Flow Diagram Shows demand, WIP, approximate average lead time and delivery rate capabilities.

To collect these metrics you only need the start and finishing date for an item then count how many items you have per day in each column.

**Explicit Policies**

Post policies where you can see them. Policies are rules for how we work and should be developed collaboratively. Example - pull criteria, wip limits, date to deploy.

**SDM**

Service Delivery Manager is a suggested role to manage the flow. SDM manages blockers, collects metrics, and supports team for flow improvement.

**Class of Service**

Class of service is based on cost of delay and defines how this category of item is
 treated in the system. A “tiger on fire” (expedite) has higher priority than other animals (standard). The most common classes of services are standard, expedite, fixed-date and intangible.

**Extra**

**_Blocker/Block Column_**

Do not have a column for blocked items. A block is a condition for an item in some column of workflow, not a part of the workflow.
