  Futurespective is the exercise to place ourselves in the future by imagining
  that our goals have been reached. They start such a retrospectives by
  discussing the team goals to ensure that team members build a common
  understanding. The goals are formulated and written down so that they are
  visible for everybody. 


  Optionally teams can write down which benefits they got from reaching their goals. If team like to party they can even do a small celebration for having reached the goals, which can help to make teams aware of the importance of reaching it.
whyDo: >-
  This practice fit for every context. You can predict the future, a little bit.
  You can learn about your wounds and scars and negativity, as you can learn
  about your hopes and positivity and good experiences.


  SMART Goals, first of all. Be careful to not have too many actions coming out of the futurespective. It helps when teams agree to only do the [](https://www.benlinders.com/2014/retrospective-exercise-vital-few-actions/) actions that are needed now to get started. There will be more retrospectives where teams can reflect and define those actions that will be most valuable to do at that time.
