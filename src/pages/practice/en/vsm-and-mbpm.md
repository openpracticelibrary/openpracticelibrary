  Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a third generation lean process improvement
  technique.  The Value Stream itself is the series of individual processes that
  connect together to create the valuable goods or service that an organization
  produces for its customer.  The process of mapping the Value Stream is
  designed to view the big, macro picture in order for executives to make
  strategic decisions as part of an extended organizational transformation
  effort.


  The first generation of this technique comes from Toyota's "information and material flow", as documented in Lean Thinking and the second generation from "Learning to See".
whyDo: >-
  In the context of software delivery, VSM is an excellent tool to holistically
  analyze and optimize existing "brownfield" delivery processes, including
  everything from requirements definition, infrastructure provisioning and
  application development.


  Being derived from Lean Manufacturing, VSM visually represents the way value flows through an organization from the time a customer requests a good/service, until the time a customer receives the good/service. This practice can be particularly effective at:


  * Building shared understanding throughout the organization on how value is actually provided 

  * Providing clarity for building concensus and creating the urgency for improvement

  * Revealing disconnect, redundancies and unnecessary complications

  * Formulating specific, data driven improvement plans

  * Applying Systems Thinking by preventing "improvement" work in a particular area that leads to sub-optimization for the entire value stream / process.

  ## Facilitation Materials Needed


  Some teams prefer whiteboards, but the most common approach uses paper and PostIts


  * Drawing paper roll.

  * Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes

  * Markers for the PostIts

  * Charcoal pencil and eraser to draw lines between PostIts


  ## How does it fit?


  VSM pairs particularly well with the [Metrics-Based Process Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/metrics-based-process-mapping/) (MBPM) practice.  Used together, VSM represents the flow of value through a system at a macro level in order to make strategic improvements whereas MBPM represents the micro lower-level flow in order to make tactical improvements.

## What is it?

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM) are third generation lean process improvement techniques, optimized for an extended organizational transformation effort. They work in tandem, where VSM is designed to view the big, macro picture and make strategic decisions with executives, and MBPM is designed to view the detailed, micro picture and make tactical improvements with front line workers. The first generation of these techniques comes from Toyota's "information and material flow" (as documented in Lean Thinking[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) and the second generation from Learning to See[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2).

## Why use VSM & MBPM?

In the context of software delivery, VSM & MBPM are excellent tools to holistically analyze and optimize "brownfield" delivery processes, including everything from requirements definition, infrastructure provisioning and application development.

Being derived from Lean Manufacturing, VSM & MBPM visually represent the way work flows through an organization, at both a macro and micro level, from the time a customer requests a good/service, until the time a customer receives the good/service. When used together, these tools are particularly effective at:

- Building shared understanding throughout the various levels of an organization on how work is actually done
- Creating the urgency for improvement
- Formulating specific, data driven improvement plans
- Preventing "improvement" work in a particular area that leads to sub-optimization for the entire value stream / process

## Facilitation Materials Needed

Some teams prefer whiteboards, but the most common approach uses paper and PostIts

- Drawing paper roll[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3).
- Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4)
- Markers for the PostIts
- Charcoal pencil and eraser[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) to draw lines between PostIts
- For MBPM; chalk line can be useful, but not required

## How does it fit?

Both VSM & MBPM document a current state map, and then design a future state map for subsequent implementation.

- The current state map is typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library.
- The future state map is typically done as part of the Outcomes area of the Discoery of the Open Practice Library.
