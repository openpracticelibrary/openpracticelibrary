whatIs: Dual Track agile is a way to incorporate user experience designers into
  agile delivery teams to support cross team collaboration, align design and
  development kanbans and optimise the efficiency of both teams. Lynn Miller
  wrote about the approach in a 2006 paper titled "[Case Study of Customer Input
  For a Successful
  Product](https://research.cs.vt.edu/ns/cs5724papers/miller.agile.pdf)". It was
  later popularised by Jeff Patton, and Marty Cagan.

  Dual Track Agile helps organisations address common challenges product delivery teams experience when scaling, particularly in environments where UX and development teams have been working in silos and are required to adapt to cross functional ways of working.


  In the absence of dual track practices, teams may experience the following challenges:


  * Designers becoming aware of developers need for wireframes too late

  * Developers receiving designs that are not possible / unnecessarily time consuming to implement

  * Designers working on features without understanding the priority from a delivery perspective


  The key benefits include:


  * Creating a shared understanding through cross collaboration

  * Validating features with customers before development begins

  * Less rework of code

  * Reducing protracted feedback loops between design and development teams
howTo: >-
  * Combine design and development teams into one team. Co-locate and setup
  spaces for collaboration (ideally with wall space and whiteboards)

  * Merge design tasks into the same product backlog as delivery tasks. 

  * Enable DesignOps. DesignOps sets standards and reÔ¨Ånes processes for the design eg. design tools and systems, communications, recruitment & scheduling of participants for testing.

  * Bake in collaborative story mapping. 

  * Delivery team members dedicate 10% of their time per sprint to collaborating with the design team on the stories in the design kanban.

  * Or - just pick one of the above and get started!
