  Test Automation allows teams to remove the slow and manual testing cycles
  related to software development. Test Automation can include such things as:


  * Static code analysis

  * Linting

  * Unit tests

  * End-to-end tests

  * C﻿onfigurations and policy checks

  * Security tests (dependencies, vulnerabilities, and pen tests)
whyDo: >-
  * ﻿Improved quality: Applying patterns like Test-Driven Development or
  Behavior-Driven Development drives up shared understanding﻿ Increase code
  quality.

  * Deliver reliably at speed: As features are produced, you can confidently release without a large manual regrestion each time.﻿ Fewer bottlenecks: Without automated tests, queues form in front of testers.

  * Faster feedback: Identifying earlier any potential failure before promote changes into production environments.

  * Standardise approach to testing: Defining a way of working where testing is another goal and benefit for the product team.
howTo: >-
  T﻿hese tests are steps of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous
  Delivery pipeline, such other main steps of the software delivery life cycle.


  Easy and quick tests can be executed right after building (compiling) an application or when code is pushed or merged in source control. End-to-End and Security tests usually are executed one the software is deployed in some non-production environment.


  Many of these tests can be run in parallel, decreasing the overall time taken to run a collection of tests.


  Tools such as [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) or [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) could be used to execute these tests.


  P﻿ublishing and visualizing the execution reports of the test is another key aspect of the Test Automation, as these reports provide a rapid visualization about the status of the quality, and results of all these steps along the life cycle of the software.


  T﻿ools such as [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/), [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) provide test reporting dashboards.

## What is it?

Test automation allows teams to remove the slow and manual testing cycles related to software development. Test automation can include such things as:

- Static code analysis
- Linting
- Unit tests
- End-to-end tests
- Security tests

These tests are typically executed by a build automation tool, for example [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/). Easy and quick tests should be ran right after building (compiling) your application, such as unit tests and static code analysis. Also many of these tests can be run in parallel, decreasing the overall time taken to run the tests.

## Why use it?

- It increases the code quality.
- It shortens feedback loops.
- It tells if your change broke some previously working code.

## How to do it?
