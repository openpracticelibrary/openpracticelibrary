  A hackathon is an event where teams get together for a short period of time to
  collaborate on a chosen topic. This event gives participants an opportunity
  away to be creative in an open collaborative environment, working rapidly with
  others towards a shared common goal. 


  Hackathons give participants the opportunity to explore, discover and tackle problems that perhaps usually the team would not have the time or resources to look into. This event can be thought of as the start of a journey in tackling those problems, supporting honest and open conversations. 


  “Hackathon is a word creation of the words hack(-ing) and marathon. In this context, hacking stands for the development of software- or hardware-solution and the marathon describes the format, which is a 1–3 days lasting event.” (Schälchli)

  One of the key suggested elements to a hackathon event is the Lean Coffee. This practice enables participants create, plan, and prepare the topics in an open environment. Additionally, within the Lean Coffee, ways of working is highlighted and results in participants grouped together in pairs or mobs working towards a shared common goal.


  The other practices that have been included in the suggested agenda work as great complimentary pieces to the overall search for team discovery. The Miro template demonstrates how each practice works together to build an engaging team event.
