  Funnel Analysis is an analytical practice studying the changes over a course
  of events or steps in a user journey. It frequently follows the flow inside an
  application towards achieving a specific goal. For example the purchasing of
  an item on an ecommerce site: the funnel analysis will show how many users go
  through the full flow of steps to complete a purchase and how many stop (drop
  off) at which step (aka fallout rates).


  The Funnel Analysis is an effective way to analyse conversion and fallout in
  applications. It is often used as a way to measure performance of similar
  products, e.g. web shops.
whyDo: >-
  * This is a feedback loop practice, which allows the team to get prompt
  feedback from real life use of their changes

  * Funnel Analysis provides a way for benchmarking of similar products

  * It enables objective, data-informed decision-making in product teams

  * When carefully followed over time, the analysis can reveal the real impact
  of product/feature changes, both positive and negative

  * This is one of the practices that allow you to “tune the engine” and carry
  “innovation accounting” ( [The Lean Startup by Eric
  Ries](http://theleanstartup.com/))

  * The practice provides an objective criteria for important decisions on the
  product design, features, behaviour, etc. It is used as a way to enhance the
  product performance, the user experience and the business outcomes the product
  produces for your organization
howTo: >-
  This practice is fed with data from [A/B
  Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/),
  [Multi-vari
  Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-multivari-testing/),
  and can be one of the final steps for running experiments which started with
  the [Design of
  Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/).
  [Feature Toggles](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/feature-toggles/)
  can greatly benefit the analysis as they can be used to tweak the application
  based on live feed of data and show if certain changes would influence the
  outcome.


  The analysis is the final step before decision-making. It aims to produce
  actionable insight on how the team can further improve the performance of the
  product and the impact of past changes.
