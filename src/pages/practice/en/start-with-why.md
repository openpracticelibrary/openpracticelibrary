  Start with why is a practice to discover your organisation's or your personal
  why. The "Why" is within you and finding your "Why" is a process of discovery,
  not invention.

  Why are you here? Why does your organisation exist? Is it just to please the
  shareholders?


  You will have heard the brilliant statement by Harvard marketing professor
  Theodore Levitt: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a
  quarter-inch hole.” In his book, This Is Marketing, Seth Godin says:

  > The lesson is that the drill bit is merely a feature, a means to an end, but
  what people truly want is the hole it makes.

  > But that doesn’t go nearly far enough. No one wants a hole.

  > What people want is the shelf that will go on the wall once they drill the
  hole.

  > Actually, what they want is how they’ll feel once they see how uncluttered
  everything is, when they put their stuff on the shelf that went on the wall
  now that there’s a quarter-inch hole.

  > But wait…

  > They also want the satisfaction of knowing they did it themselves.

  > Or perhaps the increase in status they’ll get when their spouse admires the
  the work.

  > Or the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the bedroom isn’t a mess,
  and that it feels safe and clean.

  > “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want to feel safe
  and respected.”


  Organisations often express their purpose (or their why) in dry terms such as
  "maximising shareholder value" which their customers and employees cannot
  connect to or be inspired by. For example does an organisation that tells you
  the weather exist to give you the most accurate, credible extended forecast or
  are they really there to protect you?


  ## Why use it?

  Purpose is powerful. Your purpose connects you to other people and creates
  movements. Your organisation's purpose connects and inspires people. In an
  world where it is increasingly hard to find and retain talent, your purpose is
  a powerful differentiator. Purpose drives belief and engagement.


  Dan Pink, in his book ["Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates
  Us"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us),
  says that [studies done at MIT and other
  universities](http://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersUpside/Large%20Stakes%20Big%20Mistakes.pdf),
  show that higher pay and bonuses resulted in better performance ONLY if the
  task consisted of basic, mechanical skills. It worked for problems with a
  defined set of steps and a single answer. If the task involved cognitive
  skills, decision-making, creativity, or higher-order thinking, higher pay
  resulted in lower performance. As a supervisor, you should pay employees
  enough that they are not focused on meeting basic needs and feel that they are
  being paid fairly. If you don’t pay people enough, they won’t be motivated.
  Pink suggests that you should pay enough “to take the issue of money off the
  table.”


  Pink says that in order to motivate employees who work beyond basic tasks,
  give them these three factors to increase performance and satisfaction:

  * Autonomy — Our desire to be self directed. It increases engagement over
  compliance.

  * Mastery — The urge to get better skills.

  * Purpose — The desire to do something that has meaning and is important.
  Businesses that only focus on profits without valuing purpose will end up with
  poor customer service and unhappy employees.


  Within all of us is a deep desire for meaning and our organisation's "Why" can
  help our employees and customers connect at a deeper level driving greater
  engagement.


  Simon Sinek says that trust begins to emerge when we see that people and
  organizations are driven by reasons that go beyond the self-serving. Aligning
  Why, How and What is a way to build that trust.


  Companies that act like commodity producers have a constant challenge to
  differentiate themselves from the competition. Chasing the competition, trying
  to match them feature-for-feature only deepens a “What” culture.


  Because consumers and employees are inspired by “Why” you do what you do,
  companies that begin communicating with the “Why” have a greater flexibility
  in the market.


  We’re always competing against someone else. Better quality. More features.
  Better service. We’re always comparing ourselves to the competition. And no
  one wants to help us.


  What if we showed up to work every single day to be better than ourselves? For
  no better reason than to want to leave the organization in a better state than
  we found it?


  All organizations start with “Why”, but only the great ones keep their “Why”
  clear year after year. Those who forget “Why” they were founded show up to the
  race every day to outdo someone else instead of outdoing themselves.


  You’ve probably heard that before you start a business, market research is
  key. You do your market research, know your customer and then build your
  niche. Sinek, however, disagrees. According to Sinek, the “Why” does not come
  from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and then figuring out an
  appropriate strategy to get there. It is not born out of market research or
  for that matter even extensive interviews with customers or employees. It
  comes from looking in the completely opposite direction from where you are
  right now. Finding the “Why” is a process of discovery, not invention.


  The “Why” is within you. And once you find and know your “Why”, the hardest
  part is to remain true to it.


  ## Vision and Mission Statements

  The difference between “Why” and “How” types also introduces the difference
  between the vision and mission statements of an organization.


  The vision is the founder’s intent, “Why” the company was founded. The mission
  is a description of “How” the company will create that future.


  When both are clear, it will help the “Why” and the “How” type of leaders to
  have clearly defined roles in the partnership.

  # Finding Your Why?


  Every individual or organisation can take a different approach to find their
  why.


  Red Hat used the [Open Decision
  Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework)
  across their whole organisation to[ find their
  why](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/why-open-has-been-red-hat%E2%80%99s-compass-and-purpose-25-years),
  which is "Open unlock's the world's potential".
