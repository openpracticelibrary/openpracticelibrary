  A visual approach for scoping the most important features of a
  product/service. It is a drawing of multiple concentric circles, each of which
  represents an additional layer of details for the product/service. At the core
  are the generic product/service characteristics (features), followed by
  minimal conditions circle (must haves), an augmented product circle, a
  potential circle (differentiations and customer retention features) and
  additional circles if required.
whyDo: >-
  * Opens up the product development for the whole team

  * Identifies what matters and get everyone on the team to understand the
  design and prioritisation of features 

  * Provides transparency in prioritisation and strategy/vision alignment

  * Helps move the focus on the important / differentiating features

  * When used for existing products/services allows for uncovering options for
  pivoting
howTo: >-
  * This practice could be used in combination with practices as [Impact
  Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/), Lean
  Canvas, Value Proposition in order to build a vision for a product/service and
  translate that vision into actionable and prioritized set of features.

  * The output from the practice may invoke User Research, Usability Reviews
  (for existing products/services)

  * It can also serve as prioritisation tool for the Product Backlog
