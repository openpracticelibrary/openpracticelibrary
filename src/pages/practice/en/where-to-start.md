whyDo: >-
  Many organizations have extraordinary difficulty discovering where to start a
  digital transformational journey, the complexity of such initiative creates a
  huge dilemma for these organizations. 


  ***The longer the company takes time to look ahead, will further the path be from its transformation?*** 


  In a digital transformation, people are the most crucial element, and empower them is key to success. They know everything about their business and the better path for the organization.


  The **Where To Start** is a practice with focus on people and their ability to express their feelings about the processes, with a disruptive approach to encourage participants to work together towards a new path of success.
howTo: >-
  Participants should focus on answering key questions that will help better
  address the points of cultural and digital transformation:


  * ***How is your operation?***

  * ***What is the value of this system or process?***

  * ***What is your pain?***

  * ***What is your strategy?***


  1. We start the practice with relative priorities and concentrating the team's focus on defining which system should be approached first in a transformational journey;

  2. Using sticky notes, everyone should work together to visualize how the operation is performed amongst users, systems, and the process involved;

  3. For each system, list the value obtained, the pain points, and the desires in improving each system or process - raised in the design of the process;

  4. Finally, participants should distribute these improvements in an estimated timeline and prioritize the most important ones.


  **Optional:**

  Practices such as [Priority Slides](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/priority-sliders/) can be used to prioritize improvements to the systems or processes to be focused on the timeline.
