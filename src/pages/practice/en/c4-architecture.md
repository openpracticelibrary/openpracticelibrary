whatIs: '**C4 model** is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the
  architecture of software
  systems.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_model#cite_note-:0-1) It is based
  on a structural decomposition of a system into containers and components and
  relies on existing modelling techniques such as the [Unified Modelling
  Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language
  "Unified Modeling Language") or [Entity Relation Diagrams
  (ERD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model
  "Entityâ€“relationship model") for the more detailed decomposition of the
  architectural building blocks.'
whyDo: C4 Provides a way to visualize different levels of abstraction so that a
  complex system can be discussed at different levels without requiring all
  participants to be familiar with the details of every level of the system.
howTo: C4 Diagrams should be refined and iterated on during each options pivot
  and as part of the learning portion of the delivery loop. If the C4 diagrams
  are regularly updated, it makes it faster and simpler to onboard new
  developers, achieve shared understanding across different delivery teams, and
  allows for simpler status reporting to stakeholders
