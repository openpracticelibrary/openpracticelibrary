whatIs: >-
  SWOT analysis (or SWOT matrix) is a strategic planning and strategic
  management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths,
  Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or
  project planning. 

   It is sometimes called situational assessment or situational analysis. Additional acronyms using the same components include TOWS and WOTS-UP.
whyDo: >+
  This technique is designed for use in the preliminary stages of
  decision-making processes and can be used as a tool for evaluation of the
  strategic position of organizations of many kinds (for-profit enterprises,
  local and national governments, NGOs, etc.).


  I﻿t helps to work out if something is an internal or external factor, so ask yourself if it would exist even if your business didn't. If it would, then it's an external factor (e.g. new technology)

howTo: >-
  1. Decide on the **objective** of your SWOT analysis

   To get the most out of your SWOT analysis, you should have a question or objective in mind from the start. For example, you could use a SWOT analysis to help you decide if you should introduce a new product or service, or change your processes.

  2. **Research** your business, industry and market

   Before you begin the SWOT analysis you need to do some research to understand your business, industry and market. Get a range of perspectives by talking to your staff, business partners and clients. Also conduct some market research and find out about your competitors.

  3. List your business's **strengths**

   The first step is to identify and list what you think are your business's strengths. Examples could include strengths relating to employees, financial resources, your business location, cost advantages and competitiveness.

   At this stage of the SWOT analysis, the list does not need to be definitive. Any ideas and thoughts are encouraged. Step 7 is where the list is prioritised.

  4. List your business's **weaknesses**

   List things in your business that you consider to be weaknesses (i.e. that put your business at a disadvantage to others). Weaknesses could include an absence of new products or clients, staff absenteeism, a lack of intellectual property, declining market share and distance to market.

   Make sure you address the weaknesses raised in your SWOT analysis. The list of weaknesses can indicate how your business has grown over time. When you review the SWOT analysis after a year, you may notice that your weaknesses have been resolved. While you may find new weaknesses, the fact that the old ones are gone is a sign of progress.

  5. List potential **opportunities** for your business

   Think about the possible external opportunities for your business. These are not the same as your internal strengths, and are not necessarily definite – an opportunity for one aspect of your business could be a threat to another (e.g. you may consider introducing a new product to keep up with consumer trends, but your competitors may already have a similar product). Keep this in mind, but for the SWOT analysis, the same item shouldn't be listed as both an opportunity and a threat.

   Opportunities could include new technology, training programs, partnerships, a diverse marketplace and a change of government.

  6. List potential **threats** to your business

   List external factors that could be a threat or cause a problem for your business. Examples of threats could include rising unemployment, increasing competition, higher interest rates and the uncertainty of global markets.

  7. Establish **priorities** from the SWOT

   When you have completed the steps above, you will have 4 separate lists. Ideally, these lists can be displayed side-by-side so you can have an overall picture of how your business is running and what issues you need to address. You can then work out what issues are the most important and what can be dealt with later (i.e. develop 4 prioritized lists).

  8. Develop a strategy to **address issues** in the SWOT

   Review your 4 prioritized lists by asking:

   Once you have answered these questions and finalised your lists, you can now use the SWOT analysis to develop strategies for achieving your business goals.
