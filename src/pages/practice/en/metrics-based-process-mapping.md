  **Facilitation Materials Needed**


  The practice is often performed on whiteboards, paper and sticky notes or a digital canvas.


  If performing the practice in person:


  * Drawing paper roll

  * Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes

  * Markers for the sticky notes

  * Charcoal pencil and eraser to draw lines between sticky notes

  * Chalk line can be useful, but not required


  If performing the practice remotely:


  * Consider using a digital canvas solution such as miro.com or any other visualisation tool which you prefer. Ideally the tool enables contributions from multiple participants concurrently as they can add steps and metrics to the process.


  Metrics-Based Process Mapping should be used to map out specific process steps for an agreed upon process. Through facilitation, work together to define each process step, aligned to responsible actors. For each step, estimate any or all of the following metrics as appropriate:


  * **Resources** - The quantity of resources (e.g. number of people needed to complete the step) 

  * **Process time** - the time it takes to actually perform the work

  * **Lead time** - the elapsed time from the work is made available to when it is completed and passed onto the next step

  * **% Complete & Accurate** - % time downstream customer can perform the task without having to correct, to add, or to clarify the incoming work


  Mapping the process together builds shared understanding around the process and adds visibility into the pain points and bottlenecks. These observations can help the team identify potential improvements.


  **How does it fit?**


  MBPM documents a current state map, and then designs a future state map for subsequent implementation(s).


  * The current state map is typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library.

  * The future state map is typically done as part of the Outcomes area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library.


  MBPM can be paired with [Value Stream Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/vsm-and-mbpm/). Used together, a MBPM visually details an implementation-level segment of the strategy-level value stream map. One or more Metrics-Based Process Maps may align to segments within the higher-level map.

  * A detailed process mapping practice that captures process steps, responsible actors, and key time and quality metrics

  * Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM) is a third generation lean process improvement techniques, optimizable for an extended organizational transformation effort.
whyDo: >-
  * MBPM can be used to view the detailed, micro picture and make tactical
  improvements with frontline workers

  * It is an ideal practice for process/workflow improvement related activities. For example, it's ideal for use when adopting technology automation solutions to automate a business process. 

  * Use the practice to determine a performance baseline, such as the quantity of resources and time involved before automation or process improvement is performed and again after to measure the value gained from automation or process improvement.

  * The practice highlights key performance points in processes which makes it easy to identify and prioritise areas for improvement in measurable, incremental steps.

  * The visualisation of the process is an invaluable output.

  * The clear metrics can help build a business case for changes to the process to be made.

## What is it?

* A detailed process mapping practice that captures process steps, responsible actors, and key time and quality metrics
* Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM) is a third generation lean process improvement techniques, optimizable for an extended organizational transformation effort.
* MBPM can be used to view the detailed, micro picture and make tactical improvements with frontline workers.

## Why use it?

Metrics-Based Process Mapping should be used to map out specific process steps for an agreed upon process.  Through facilitation, work together to define each process step, aligned to responsible actors.  For each step, estimate the following metrics:

* **Process time** - the time it takes to actually perform the work
* **Lead time** - the elapsed time from the work is made available to when it is completed and passed onto the next step
* **% Complete & Accurate** - % time downstream customer can perform the task without having to correct, to add, or to clarify the incoming work

Mapping the process together builds shared understanding around the process and adds visibility into the pain points and bottlenecks.  These observations can help the team identify potential improvements.

## How does it fit?

MBPM documents a current state map, and then designs a future state map for subsequent implementation(s).

* The current state map is typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library.
* The future state map is typically done as part of the Outcomes area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library.

MBPM can be paired with Value Stream Mapping. Used together, a MBPM visually details an implementation-level segment of the strategy-level value stream map.  One or more Metrics-Based Process Maps may align to  segments within the higher-level map.

## Facilitation Materials Needed

Some teams prefer whiteboards, but the most common approach uses paper and PostIts

* Drawing paper roll
* Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes4
* Markers for the Post-Its
* Charcoal pencil and eraser to draw lines between Post-Its
* Chalk line can be useful, but not required
