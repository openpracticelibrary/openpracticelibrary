  The Non-Functional Requirements Map is a tool to capture and articulate the
  non-functional requirements of a solution that a team is striving to deliver.
  It aims to elaborate non-functional areas that are unlikely to be captured
  using practices primarily focused on functional aspects of a solution.


  Non-functional requirements are broken down into areas represented by each
  segment on the canvas which are examined and populated in turn as a group.

  Findings and learnings from other [Discovery
  practices](https://openpracticelibrary.com/#discovery-loop-outcomes) can be
  input into this practice if appropriate.

  1. Ensure that everyone participating is comfortable with the headings and
  what they mean.

  2. For each heading capture important considerations or requirements for the
  system or solution and add stickies for each item. Depending on the number of
  participants, you could use facilitation techniques such as 1-2-4-all or
  splitting into smaller groups to capture items.

  3. For each heading playback the stickies as a group.

  4. During the playback think about whether each sticky should be:
     * An item added to the backlog and prioritised as it requires work to realise.
     * An item that should be included in the [Definition of Done](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-done/) for other backlog items.
     * Part of the acceptance criteria for other backlog items.

  ### Facilitation Materials Needed

  #### *Digital Variation:*

  * An online whiteboard (such as Miro) with a canvas created for the
  Non-Functional Requirements Map

  #### *Physical Variation:*

  * A large whiteboard or writable wall space * Whiteboard markers * Stickies

  ### Tips for Remote Sessions

  You should follow the general guidance in [Facilitation Tips for Remote
  Sessions](https://openpracticelibrary.com/perspective/facilitation-tips-for-remote-sessions/).
  There are no specific considerations for this practice.
