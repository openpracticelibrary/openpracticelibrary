  How-Now-Wow is a prioritisation matrix / idea selection tool, which is often
  combined with Brainstorming, HMW, Design of Experiments.


  It compares and plot ideas on a 2x2 matrix by comparing the idea’s difficulty to implement with its novelty/originality.

whyDo: >+
  Creative teams can generate a lot of ideas. Too many ideas to implement.
  Categorising ideas according to whether or not they are easy to do, and truly
  new and innovative can help the team decide where best to focus their effort. 

howTo: >-
  Look at each idea, one by one, asking two key questions.


  1. How hard or easy would this be to implement? 

     Place the idea somewhere along the vertical scale, close to zero if easy, or 5 if it would be difficult, or 3 if it is in the middle.
  2. How new, or original is this idea? 

     The more innovative the idea is, move it further along the horizontal scale.

  Finally review the grid to choose what to do next:


  * **Now**. Ideas in the bottom left are easy to implement, and could be done straight away.

  * **How?** Ideas in the top right are innovative, but may require some research first.

  * **Wow!!!** Ideas in the bottom right are both easy and innovative, so this is where best to focus time and energy first.

  * Ideas in the top may be hard to implement and are not really new, so it is probably best to focus effort elsewhere.

## What is it?

How-Now-Wow is a prioritisation matrix / idea selection tool, which is often combined with Brainstorming, HMW, Design of Experiments.

It compares and plot ideas on a 2x2 matrix by comparing the idea’s difficulty to implement with its novelty/originality.

## Why use it?

* This practice opens up the product development for the whole team
* Developing new products goes hand in hand with generation of ideas, hypothesis and their testing/validation. Unfortunately, it is mostly impossible to test and evaluate all ideas and hypothesis we can come up with. This requires us to filter and prioritize which of them to work on
* It is a simple, easy to understand, very visual and can include the whole team in the process of transparent selection of ideas/hypothesis to work on first
* Helps the Product Managers (Product Owners) in prioritisation, building the product roadmap/backlog and explaining priorities to stakeholders
* It helps identify directions and ideas for pivoting

## Why & How to combine it with other practices?

The source of ideas and hypothesis are practices like [Event Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/), [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/), [HMW](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/hmw/), User Research, [Empathy Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/empathy-mapping/). While we perform those aforementioned practices, often ideas would emerge for possible improvements or new hypothesis may form. Some of them may be already formulated as [HMW](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/hmw/) questions.

Before adding any of them as items on the Product Backlog these ideas & hypothesis would typically need some research, analysis and further elaboration. As any team has a limit of bandwidth and attention, prioritisation is required and any activities would be added as items in the Product Backlog.

Once prioritised these ideas & hypothesis may lead to:

* New stories being added
* Complete new features being broken down into new stories
* User Research
* [Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/)
* Spikes
