  A "Stop the World" event is when somebody on the Team identifies that the
  engagement is off-course for one reason or another. The *FULL* Team then works
  together to find a compromise that is acceptable to all and continues progress
  towards customer success. By the end of the "Stop the World" event, the team
  should:

  - All be in agreement with the proposed compromise


  - Identify actions or changes and owners


  - Maintain good Psychological Safety among the Team

  - There is an aspect of the engagement that is found to be missing. A key
  output or outcome that supports customer success.


  - A practice or an outcome needs to change based on new customer information.
  This change is one that would fundamentally change an output or outcome
  previously agreed to.


  - The delivery team skillset changes for any reason that would affect customer
  success.


  - Priority with the customer fundamentally changes the previously agreed
  direction of the delivery team.


  - An previously agreed to input to a practice is not met or will not be met.

## What is it?

A "Stop the World" event is when somebody on the Team identifies that the engagement is off-course for one reason or another. The _FULL_ Team then works together to find a compromise that is acceptable to all and continues progress towards customer success. By the end of the "Stop the World" event, the team should:

- All be in agreement with the proposed compromise
- Identify actions or changes and owners
- Maintain good Psychological Safety[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) among the Team

- A practice or an outcome needs to change based on new customer information. This change is one that would fundamentally change an output or outcome previously agreed to.
- The delivery team skillset changes for any reason that would affect customer success.
- Priority with the customer fundamentally changes the previously agreed direction of the delivery team.
- An previously agreed to input to a practice is not met or will not be met
