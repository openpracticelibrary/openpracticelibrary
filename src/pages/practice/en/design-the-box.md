  This Design Thinking practice is exactly what the title says - the team
  members have to imagine the box/packaging for a new product. They need to come
  up with slogans that correspond to the essence of the product/service,
  highlight the most important valuable features it aims at.

  It gets the team to think from a big picture perspective and from the shoes of
  the potential customers and to start designing a new product/service.

  In different formats you may either start with a blank box or provide carton
  to  participants and ask them to design the box in the process.
whyDo: >-
  * Helps translate vision into a set of characteristics to describe how it
  would feel and look when achieved

  * It allows to easily articulate the product/service goal

  * Allows the team to think big without the constraints of the present and the
  context they are in or where they are coming from

  * Serves as a stepping stone to Value Proposition or Lean Canvas by
  articulating some of the most important use cases, features and benefits.

  * Provides really good input for the goal to be used in Impact Mapping
howTo: >-
  ### Why & How to combine it with other practices?

  * This practice is really helpful if you find it hard to articulate the goal
  during an [Impact
  Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/) session. It
  can help articulate product vision and ambitions

  * It is also a good transition from a vision into a more concrete description
  of expected product/service design, e.g. through [Event
  Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/)

  * It can provide interesting input for Value Proposition and Lean Canvas
