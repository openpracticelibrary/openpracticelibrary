  It is a 5 day customer-centric process for rapidly solving a key challenge,
  creating new products, or improving existing ones.

  Design sprints enable you to:

  * Clarify the problem at hand, and identify the needs of potential users

  * Explore solutions through brainstorming and sketching exercises

  * Distil your ideas into one or two solutions that you can test

  * Prototype your solution and bring it to life

  * Test the prototype with people who would use it

  The process phases include: Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype and Validate.
whyDo: >-
  The aim is to fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and
  customer reactions, before making any expensive commitment. It is a simple and
  cheap way to validate major assumptions, the Big question/s and point to the
  different options to explore further through delivery.

  This set of practices reduces risks when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. Design Sprints are the fastest way to find out if a product or project is worth undertaking, if a feature is worth the effort, or if your value proposition is really valid. For the latter one should also consider running a [Research Sprint](https://library.gv.com/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions-97279b532b25).

  It compresses work into one week and importantly tests the design idea and provides real user feedback in rapid fashion.

  ### A Sample Agenda

  By now there are many different variations of the format. You may come across the Google variation, a GV variation, the Design Sprint 2.0 (which is the agenda shown below).

  The best is to try different variations and judge which one works for what context.

  #### Monday

  * Intro * How Might We * Map * Lightning Demos * Notes Taking * Crazy 8's * Long Term Goals * Sprint Questions * Lightning Demos * Drawing Ideas * Start user test recruiting * Develop Concepts

  #### Tuesday

  * Decide on Solution * Storyboard design * Decider Vote * Storyboard Final Walk-through * User test recruiting

  #### Wednesday

  * Prototype creation * User test preparation * Interview room setup

  #### Thursday

  * Testing with end-users * Analyse results and prepare findings

  #### Friday

  * Showcase (demonstrate process & findings)
