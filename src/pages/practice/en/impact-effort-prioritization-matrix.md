  This is a decision-making / prioritization practice for selection of ideas
  (feature ideas, performance ideas, growth ideas). It is a 2 by 2 matrix
  comparing Impact vs Effort. A variation of the matrix may consider
  Effort+Costs or Complexity as representation of both effort and costs.


  * Best Ideas - High Impact / Low Effort

  * Research required - High Impact / High Effort

  * Things to avoid - Low Impact / Low Effort

  * Bad ideas - Low Impact / High Effort

whyDo: >-
  * This practice opens up the product development for the whole team

  * Developing new products goes hand in hand with generation of ideas,
  hypothesis and their testing/validation. Unfortunately, it is mostly
  impossible to test and evaluate all ideas and hypothesis we can come up with.
  This requires us to filter and prioritize which of them to work on

  * It is a simple, easy to understand, very visual and can include the whole
  team in the process of transparent selection of ideas/hypothesis to work on
  first

  * Helps the Product Managers (Product Owners) in prioritisation, building the
  product roadmap/backlog and explaining priorities to stakeholders

  * It helps identify directions and ideas for pivoting

  The source of ideas and hypothesis are practices like [Event
  Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/), [Impact
  Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/),
  [HMW](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/hmw/), User Research, [Empathy
  Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/empathy-mapping/). While we
  perform those aforementioned practices, often ideas would emerge for possible
  improvements or new hypothesis may form. Some of them may be already
  formulated as [HMW](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/hmw/) questions.


  Before adding any of them as items on the Product Backlog these ideas &
  hypothesis would typically need some research, analysis and further
  elaboration. As any team has a limit of bandwidth and attention,
  prioritisation is required and any activities would be added as items in the
  Product Backlog.


  Once prioritised these ideas & hypothesis may lead to:


  * New stories being added

  * Complete new features being broken down into new stories

  * User Research

  * [Design of

  * Spikes

* Best Ideas - High Impact / Low Effort
* Research required - High Impact / High Effort
* Things to avoid - Low Impact / Low Effort
* Bad ideas - Low Impact / High Effort
