  Cohort analysis is a subset of behaviour analytics which studies the
  difference in behaviour between different groups of people (customers /
  users), aka cohorts.


  Instead of treating all users as part of one population, cohort analysis is
  segmenting the population in cohorts which share a common characteristic and
  then search for patterns in their behaviours.


  The discriminating characteristic can be derived from the main personas (e.g.
  skill level) or from the events and timeline relative to the product (new
  users, returning users, users from month x, etc.)
howTo: >-
  * Use Annotations: Start using Google Analytics Annotations or a marketing
  calendar to track your marketing activities and campaigns. This will help you
  see the impact of your marketing initiatives in Google Analytics reports,
  including the Cohort Analysis report.


  * Test Your Marketing Activities: Start running experiments to test audiences,
  channels, and website design by week or by month (eg test one marketing
  channel per month). Schedule a half-hour one day every week to look at your
  Cohort Analysis report to check the results of these tests.


  * Drill Down on Unusual Cohorts: If you see significant increases or decreases
  in metrics like user retention for a certain cohort, check your marketing
  calendar to identify what changes could be driving these movements in your
  metrics. Turn these cohorts of interest into custom segments to dig deeper
  into their behavior.

  This is a feedback loop practice, which allows the team to get prompt feedback
  from real life use of their changes.


  The Cohort Analysis aims to produce actionable insights, which can inform
  better product decisions instead of using gut feel.


  This practice enables product decisions for improvement, enhancement, overhaul
  or discontinuing of products/features. It is key practice in the sequence of
  practices which start with [Design of
  experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/)
  and aims to improve the product performance in terms of business outcomes.


  The cohort analysis helps the team understand the impact of product/feature
  changes by comparing performance across comparable data sets (e.g. newly
  signed up users). It can help drive improvements towards a achieving a
  concrete and measurable goal, the pursuit of which results in change of user
  behaviour.
