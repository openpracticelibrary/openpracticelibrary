  The priority validation canvas is a tool used to surface high risk work items.
  This canvas looks at work through the lens of complexity by focusing on the
  teams' knowledge. Understanding which work items need attention allows
  managers to intervene.


  In most cases, this will lead to identifying and prioritizing the most unknown work higher in the backlog. Doing this will de-risk the backlog and improve predictability for the team. As with all remote:af patterns, the backlog filter is designed to be effective regardless of context and can be used across many types of teams.


  The remote:af backlog filter has been made available to the public for use. All copyright in the canvas is owned by Remote Agility Framework Pty Ltd and used under license.
