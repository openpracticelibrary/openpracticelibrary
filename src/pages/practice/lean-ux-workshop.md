whatIs: In a Lean UX Workshop, participants practice interviewing and learning about a user. Then, they prototype and refine a product that solves a real problem faced by that person.
whyDo: This practice helps build a culture of user-centered design and lean UX. It's a hands-on activity that can provide a break from presentations or technical workshops. It's also a great icebreaker!

  ### Materials Needed

  * A timer or stopwatch (the [Time Timer](https://www.timetimer.com/) is great)

  * A whiteboard (optional)
  
  * Lots of Lego! The [Large Creative Brick box](https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/classic/products/lego-large-creative-brick-box-10698) is great.

  ### Steps

  Before each step, spend a minute or two explaining what participants will do and answering questions.


  * Introduce Lean UX and user-centered design. Depending on the audience, consider one or more of the following *(10-15 min)*:
    * Demonstrate a mock user interview
    * Show a short video
    * Describe an experience practicing user-centered design.
  * Ask people to self-organize into groups of three and pick a role: User, Designer, or Developer.

  * Ask the designer to interview the user. *(3 min)*
    * The designer asks user about his or her morning routine (from waking up to arriving at work).
    * The interviewer looks for a problem that the user ran into and asks open-ended questions to learn more.
  * Ask the developer and designer to prototype a solution to the problem using Lego. *(7 min)*

  * Have the developer and designer present their solution to user and get feedback. If possible, they should let the user try out the product! *(3 min)*

  * Have the team refine the Lego solution and gather additional feedback. *(7 min)*

  * Ask two or three teams present their solutions. *(5 min)*


  The facilitator should move from table to table to make sure teams are progressing. If teams finish early, they can build another prototype and A/B test the solution.

  #### Tips

  Consider writing these notes on a whiteboard.

  * Ask open-ended questions - not closed (yes/no) questions.

  * Use the "ladder" technique: keep asking "why" to learn more.

  * When you have something to measure, use ratings on on a scale from 1 to 11. This helps participants give honest feedback instead of thinking of the rating like a grade in school.

## What is it?

In a Lean UX Workshop, participants practice interviewing and learning about a user. Then, they prototype and refine a product that solves a real problem faced by that person.

## Why use it?

This practice helps build a culture of user-centered design and lean UX. It's a hands-on activity that can provide a break from presentations or technical workshops. It's also a great icebreaker!

## How to facilitate

Before each step, spend a minute or two explaining what participants will do and answering questions.

* Introduce Lean UX and user-centered design. Depending on the audience, consider one or more of the following *(10-15 min)*:

  * Demonstrate a mock user interview
  * Show a short video
  * Describe an experience practicing user-centered design.
* Ask people to self-organize into groups of three and pick a role: User, Designer, or Developer.
* Ask the designer to interview the user. *(3 min)*

  * The designer asks user about his or her morning routine (from waking up to arriving at work).

* [Objectified: Smart Design OXO Good Grips Story](https://vimeo.com/106963722)

  * This video is a great example of a team using user-centered design to solve real problems and develop a business valued at [worth hundreds of millions of dollars](https://web.archive.org/web/20161009174354/http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/helen-of-troys-winning-acquisitions-hele-npk-lcut-nc-jah0706.aspx).
* [Lean UX](https://www.jeffgothelf.com/lean-ux-book/)

  * This book covers the overall "How" and "Why" behind this activity. It arranges practices around a "Build, Measure, Learn" loop.
* [Design Thinking 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/)

  * This article explains design thinking in terms of a "Understand, Explore, Materialize" loop, which is similar to the Lean UX loop.
* [Usability Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/usability-testing/)

  * This practice is similar to the open-ended interview we run here.

  * An activity with the author of this post helped inspire the Lean UX Workshop!
