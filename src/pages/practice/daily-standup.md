# What is it?

* The main point of a daily standup (Daily Scrum) is for the team to better align towards the sprint goal
* Teams get together to share transparently the ongoing work and highlight roadblocks/impediments they might be facing
* It is a review of the things that were DONE and things we intend to get DONE.
* Typically this is achieved by team members answering 3 questions

  1. What did you do yesterday?
  2. What will you do today?
  3. Do you have any blockers or impediments?

# Why use it?

* Provides a quick touchpoint on what is going on with the team
* Quick feedback on impediments and keep people honest and transparent
* Focus on getting things done rather than what keeps us busy
* It is a reinforcement of the goal and direction the team is after and a point of recharging the team with new energy for pursuing the goal

## Advice

* As mentioned above, the main point of a stand up is alignment. Be careful it doesn't drift into a status update, focus on what those around you need to know and park any conversations not relevant until the end.

## Tips for Remote Working

* Cameras on and everyone contributes.
* Use video conference tools. Everyone logs in separately - if a few people are co-located it can be difficult if that group is dialled in together.
* Use an online visual timer to keep to the 15 minute timebox for stand-up. The core agenda is:
     1. What I did yesterday
     2. What I am doing today
     3. I have blockers

* People tend to talk more for socialisation and for status updates, for this reason leave 5 minutes more at the end for these aspects that can be more relevant being distributed
* Consider that the team may be distributed across multiple time zones so agree a time that is cognisant if this.
* Collectively create a list of topics that need to be discussed after the standup, adding to a blockers board or in the parking lot.
