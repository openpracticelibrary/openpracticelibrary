  A hackathon is an event where teams get together for a short period of time to
  collaborate on a chosen topic. This event gives participants an opportunity
  away to be creative in an open collaborative environment, working rapidly with
  others towards a shared common goal. 


  Hackathons give participants the opportunity to explore, discover and tackle problems that perhaps usually the team would not have the time or resources to look into. This event can be thought of as the start of a journey in tackling those problems, supporting honest and open conversations. 


  “Hackathon is a word creation of the words hack(-ing) and marathon. In this context, hacking stands for the development of software- or hardware-solution and the marathon describes the format, which is a 1–3 days lasting event.” (Schälchli)
