title: The Organum - Structuring a whole Project's Knowledge
subtitle: A project's wiki can be a very helpful time-saving source of
  information. Yet, consistantly organizing all the information about a project
  in order to cut-down search delays is not obvious. Here is a template with key
  guidelines.

  It is essential to structure knowledge in order to share it efficiently. Well
  documented code is just one aspect. Tasks, plans, reports, and project
  presentations are also much known. But there's much more, ranging from early
  sketches to specifications, deployment tips, knowledge route maps, training
  materials, test samples, operational procedures, project's organization,
  meeting notes, formal models, techniques, and so forth. 


  How can you organize all that knowledge cleanly, and notably using a wiki... so that it would not just be useful to developers and frustrate managers hardly finding the information they seek, or vice-versa ? How so many people with so different information requirements can all be satisfied at the same time?


  W﻿iki's with rich **hyperlinked** pages definitely help providing multiple navigation paths into the same information. A good bunch of **tags and keywords** significantly accelerate searches. Yet a wiki is basically organized as a hierarchical set of pages whose structure is also often used to navigate.  


  W﻿hat kind of structure would be most efficient?
whyDo: >-
  Save time organizing and structuring all kinds of information about a
  project. 


  Start with a structure that will be sustainable and can cleanly host un-anticipated information categories as the project progresses. Stop wondering where the hell this team (or a colleague) has stored the kind of information you look for with a clean - repeatable - project knowledge structure that can become a common template for all kinds of projects.


  Foster considerable time savings when you search info about a project, either when you join it, either when the project is rich and complex and drives ["cognitive overloads"](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/cognitive-loadometer/) forcing you to permanently refresh your knowledge to be productive.
howTo: >-
  F﻿ollow the "Organum" structure illustrated here as source of inspiration for
  adding pages to your project's wiki. The structure is borrowed from the
  methodology ["Praxeme"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxeme) whose
  *Enterprise System Topology* is supported by means to organize all the
  information about a project from design to delivery. A simplified [Organum
  ](https://www.praxeme.org/thesaurus/organum/?lang=en)is proposed here that is
  sufficient for 90% of IT projects.

  D﻿O NOT FORGET:


  * T﻿he first purpose of a knowledge repository is to **save time**: finding the right information in minimum time.

  * A﻿void pure hierachical project pages in a wiki; i.e. 'empty' pages that only hold a path to (or group) child pages and contain no information but at most a listing of sub-pages. There is always something to tell about any level of information and surely helpful guidance and links to provide.

  * N﻿ever forget to **tag** wiki pages with keywords, and provide a cloud of tags elsewhere

  * H﻿yperlink your content. The page hierarchy is only your storage structure. Navigation is most efficient via hyperlinks that help navigate in all directions, not only top-down.

  * A﻿ **link** to the information is as useful as the information itself; henceforth avoid copying and duplicating but link it.

  * The Organum is not about a project wiki alone, but about everything that concerns a software project. Part of this global information is better hosted by specialized servers for source control and source code documentation (e.g. GitHub / GitLab), project management (e.g. JIRA), bug tracking, modelling (e.g. Modelio, Enterprise Architect, Mega), and of course API Management (e.g. Swagger, Postman, etc.). Do not duplicate this information but link it abundantly. The project's wiki will become the entry point to everything about a project.
