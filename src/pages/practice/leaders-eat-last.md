whatIs: This concept is based on the United States Marine Corps' practice of
  placing the needs of your Marines before you own. When a unit in the Marine
  Corps is conducting training or deployed abroad, they will eat their meals
  together as a team; from the most senior officer to the youngest enlisted
  Marine. In this environment, one might think that those senior leaders would
  get their food first, but it is the exact opposite. The call will come out for
  the lowest rank to line up for chow, and taking it a step further, the most
  senior Marines present **serve** **their subordinates**. This selfless act
  shows the Marines that their leadership cares about them and that if there is
  a shortage on food, they will be the ones to go without eating. This also
  allows the leaders to see and talk to all of the Marines as they make their
  way through the chow line, assessing their physical and mental wellbeing which
  can be deteriorated in extreme training or combat conditions.
whyDo: This simple gesture can have a profound impact on the way a team
  interacts. In the Marine Corps, it is an honor and privilege to serve those
  junior to your own rank. While allowing others to eat first is just one small
  example of this, it can be used in many facets of leadership. Placing the
  needs of the team before your own breaks down the mentality of, "I am senior
  to you, so I have more privileges," and replaces it with, "My seniority comes
  with more responsibilities, and it is my charged duty to take care of my
  teammates and ensure their success." Through this, an atmosphere is fostered
  in which the team trusts one another and feel like they belong. When the team
  cares for each other, they don't feel threatened from within and can focus
  their energy on common goals.
howTo: >-
  This simple idea is not so simple to implement. It requires a mindset shift
  from self preservation to team preservation. This includes those times when
  everyone is tired and everything seems to be falling apart. It might be best
  to implement in the little things you do to start developing the habit. It can
  be consistently showing up to appointments 5 minutes early, asking the team if
  they would like a drink when you are making a run to the store, asking what
  you can do to help or support the team, volunteering to work the extra hour,
  or giving the credit for success to the team while assuming responsibility
  when the team fails.
