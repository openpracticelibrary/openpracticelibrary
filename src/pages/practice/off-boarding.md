whatIs: Using
  [Everything-as-Code](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/everything-as-code/)
  by putting all infrastructure and configuration data into code, applications
  can be deployed in a repeatable and reliable fashion. Put it into action!
  Deploy code in one environment, and then re-deploy into another
  environment.  Or destroy the first one and re-deploy :D
howTo: Practice on a cadence (1-3 weeks) in order to catch all the bugs! Keep
  repeating until all the bugs are caught! It gets easier each time, and
  everyone on the team should practice it for a shared understanding.
