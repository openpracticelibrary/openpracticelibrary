  **Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
  specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
  electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.


  N﻿ot so far.

  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
whyDo: >-
  In preparation for the first session, I asked the group, a subset of the team,
  to write down 10 issues and/or challenges with how they work today. I asked
  them not think about solutions or how they would like it to be, just state the
  challenges as is and we’ll tackle them together later on. I was deliberately a
  bit vague on the content of the workshop, I wanted them to lean into the
  unknown for a while and keep away from problem solving too early. Tricky to
  replicate


  Ideally we would have the whole team in the workshop at the same time, but we did what we could. The participants in the first session listed their individual 10 issues, discussed and clustered where appropriate, and then tried to find representative issues for the two ends of the scale Unpredictable to Predictable. Once agreed, they could continue to map out the remaining sticky notes on the line, discussing them, and making sure no two sticky notes were on the same spot. There were a few leftovers the group didn’t have time for when the session ended.
