whatIs: "A one-pager is a concise, single-page document that visually summarises
  a project, initiative, product, business etc.. "
whyDo: >2
   It helps teams and stakeholders gain a shared understanding of the project's goals, target audience, functionalities, benefits, risks and so on.

  Increased Efficiency: Saves time by providing a central reference point.
howTo: >-
  How do I execute this practice:


  1. Define the Purpose: Clearly state the purpose of the one-pager. Is it to gain buy-in for a new initiative, explain a complex feature, or communicate project progress?

  2. Identify Your Audience: Tailor the content and language to resonate with your target audience (e.g., technical team, executives, customers).

  3. Content Creation: Include key information such as:

  4. * Project/Initiative/Product Name
     * Problem Addressed
     * Outcome/Bet
     * Proposed Solution
     * Target Audience/Users
     * Key functionalities/Benefits
     * Risks/Constraints/Dependencies
     * Timeline (optional)
     * Team & resources
     * Call to Action (optional)

  Typically the content needs to be tailored to the specifics of your one-pager


  4. Visual Appeal: Use visuals like diagrams, charts, or images to enhance understanding and make the document visually engaging.

  5. Review and Refine: Get feedback from colleagues and revise for clarity and conciseness.

  6. Keep it up-to-date while progressing the initiative to allow new participants to get the right understanding at any time they join the initiative.
