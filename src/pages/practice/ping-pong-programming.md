  Ping-Pong Programming (aka. Ping-Pong Pair Programming) is a kind of [Pair Programming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/pair-programming/) that TDD ([Test Driven Development](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/test-driven-development/)) is included while in practice. In other words, it is a combination of Pair Programming and TDD.

whyDo: >-
  In addition to the [Pair Programming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/pair-programming/)'s own benefits, Ping-Pong Pair Programming has the following advantages:


  * [TDD](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd) :)


  * Easier to find the rhythm of the development flow which can be a problem when it comes to switching pairs.


  * A much smaller problem space needs to be managed, so this enables developers to sync with the flow quicker than other styles.


  * Avoids mismatched pair issues -like one developer knows more than the other- as each developer takes turns writing tests and making them pass.


  * The work is gamified, so it puts another kind of motivation for developers.
howTo: >-
  Let's say there are two developers, developer A and developer B. The development flow goes like the following:


  * A writes a failing test.


  * B makes the test pass writing only enough code to make the test pass.


  * B writes the next test.


  * A writes only enough code to make that test pass.


  * Continue until A and B both agree that there are no more tests for the unit they are currently working on.


  * Either developer can refactor the code only all tests stays "passing".


  The optimal setup to work in this rhythm is two developers sitting side by side, a single computer with two input devices: That’s two monitors, two keyboards, and two mice. However, developers may do pairs remotely if they work in a remote environment via tools like [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) etc.


  Ping-Pong programming can also be done in a group which is a form of [Mob Programming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/mob-programming/). So it can be called Ping-Pong Mob Programming:


  * A developer writes a failing unit test.


  * Another developer -maybe the one next to her/him- writes as little code as possible to make the test pass.


  * Another developer -maybe the one next to her/him- writes a failing unit test. And it continues like this...


  * Any developer can refactor any code when needed but only when the tests pass.


  * When the driver asks for help, the rest of the group politely helps out without any other interruption.

## What is it?

Ping-Pong Programming (aka. Ping-Pong Pair Programming) is a kind of [Pair Programming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/pair-programming/) that TDD ([Test Driven Development](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/test-driven-development/)) is included while in practice. In other words, it is a combination of Pair Programming and TDD.

## Why use it?

In addition to the [Pair Programming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/pair-programming/)'s own benefits, Ping-Pong Pair Programming has the following advantages:

- [TDD](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd) :)
- Easier to find the rhythm of the development flow which can be a problem when it comes to switching pairs.
- A much smaller problem space needs to be managed, so this enables developers to sync with the flow quicker than other styles.
- Avoids mismatched pair issues -like one developer knows more than the other- as each developer takes turns writing tests and making them pass.
- The work is gamified, so it puts another kind of motivation for developers.

## How to do it?

Let's say there are two developers, developer A and developer B. The development flow goes like the following:

- A writes a failing test.
- B makes the test pass writing only enough code to make the test pass.
- B writes the next test.
- A writes only enough code to make that test pass.
- Continue until A and B both agree that there are no more tests for the unit they are currently working on.
- Either developer can refactor the code only all tests stays "passing".

The optimal setup to work in this rhythm is two developers sitting side by side, a single computer with two input devices: That’s two monitors, two keyboards, and two mice. However, developers may do pairs remotely if they work in a remote environment via tools like [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) etc.
