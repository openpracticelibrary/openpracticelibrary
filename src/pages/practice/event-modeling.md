  Event Modeling is a way to design a blueprint for an Information System of any
  size or scale. It is done in a way that allows the clearest communication of
  the system's workings to the largest possible cross-section of roles in an
  organization. The system can be checked for completeness by following the
  single thread of data propagation through it.
