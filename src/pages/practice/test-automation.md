  Test automation allows teams to remove the slow and manual testing cycles related to software development. Test automation can include such things as:

  * Static code analysis

  * Linting

  * Unit tests

  * End-to-end tests

  * Security tests

  These tests are typically executed by a build automation tool, for example [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/). Easy and quick tests should be ran right after building (compiling) your application, such as unit tests and static code analysis. Also many of these tests can be run in parallel, decreasing the overall time taken to run the tests.
