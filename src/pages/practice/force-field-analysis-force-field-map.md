  This is a simple way for evaluating the forces pro and con that are at play
  with regards to certain change. Typically, this is a change the organization
  is interested in or faces.


  This is a method coming from the field of Social Science and developed by Kurt
  Lewin.


  Dave Gray has introduced a map (Force Field Map), which provides an excellent
  canvas for having a conversation with all participants in front of a flipchart
  or whiteboard.

whyDo: >-
  * Change cannot be managed. It can only be facilitated. To facilitate
  something one has to build sufficient understanding of it

  * Organizational systems are complex systems and require system thinking for
  their understanding. Force field analysis is a way to open the door to systems
  thinking in situations where organisations are going through change

  * Provides a good understanding of the environment, which in turn could allow
  for Lean Change Management practices to be used for facilitating the change
  process
howTo: >-
  1. Before the meeting, draw a picture of a potential change in the middle of a
  large sheet of paper or a whiteboard. You can draw a literal representation
  (e.g., a manufacturing plant) or a more abstract representation (e.g., a
  metaphor). Label the picture to ensure that everyone participating will be
  clear on the topic.

  2. On the top left of the page, write the phrase “Forces FOR Change”. On the
  top right, write the phrase “Forces AGAINST Change”.

  3. Draw arrows on both sides pointing toward the image in the middle. These
  will be the areas that contain categories generated by the group, so make the
  arrows large enough to write 1–2-inch letters inside. If you like the “wow”
  factor of drawing live with the group but you’re not yet comfortable with
  freehand, sketch the arrows in pencil or yellow marker and trace them during
  the meeting.

  4. When the group is gathered, introduce the change topic and explain that the
  goal of the Force Field Analysis game is to evaluate the feasibility of that
  change.

  5. Ask the players to take 5–10 minutes and quietly generate ideas about what
  elements are driving the change. Tell them to include one idea per sticky
  note.

  6. Ask the players to take 5–10 minutes and quietly generate ideas about what
  elements are restraining the change.

  7. Draw a simple scale with a range of 1 to 5 on your main flip chart.
  Indicate that 1 means the force is weak and 5 means the force is strong. Ask
  them to review each idea FOR change and add a number to that sticky note,
  weighting that idea. Ask them to review each idea AGAINST change and add a
  number to that sticky note, weighting that idea.

  8. Gather all of the sticky notes FOR change and post them to any flat surface
  viewable by the players.

  9. With the group’s collaboration, sort the ideas based on their affinity to
  other ideas. For example, if they produced three sticky notes that say “Can’t
  continue production at current cost”, “Materials cost too high”, and
  “Overexpenditure on production”, cluster those ideas together. Create multiple
  clusters until you have clustered the majority of the sticky notes. Place
  outliers separate from the clusters but still in playing\nrange.

  10. After the sorting activity is complete, begin a group conversation to
  create an overarching category for each cluster. For example, an overarching
  category for the cluster from step 9 might be “unsustainable costs”.

  11. As the group makes suggestions and finds agreement on categories, write
  those categories inside the arrows on the main visual.

  12. As you categorize each cluster, direct the group’s attention to the
  numeric scores within that cluster. Get an average for each cluster and write
  that number next to the related category in the arrow.

  13. Repeat steps 8–12 using the sticky notes generated AGAINST change.

  14. Add the quantities for and against change and write the totals at the
  bottom and on the appropriate side of the sheet.

  15. Summarize the overall findings with the group, including the numeric
  totals, and discuss the implications of whether change should occur.
