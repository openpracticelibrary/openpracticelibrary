  Docs As Code (also known as “Docs Like Code”) is a popular approach to
  delivering documentation for software projects.


  There are three common themes that you can expect to see.


  1. Adopt an “[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)” approach to content creation

  2. The whole team is responsible for content, not just the technical writers

  3. A culture of adaptation and improvement to both content, and  processes, over time.

whyDo: >
  * Deliver valuable documentation faster with higher quality, because there are
  multiple voices working collaboratively

  * Avoid documentation being a bottleneck in the release cycle

  * Release technical writers to deliver higher value content (information architecture, customer experience, ....)

  * Remove need for proprietary technical writing and publication tools.
howTo: >-
  Use developer tools, and process, to create and deliver content. Specifically:


  1. Text based file content with embedded, lightweight, markup tags. Examples include [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText), [AsciiDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc)


  2. Developer based workflows. For example:

     1. Version Control using tools, such as [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
     2. Change control driven though bugs and feature requests tickets
     3. Content reviews and merges

  3. Machine generated content. For example:
   
   ﻿  1. Diagrams from text using tools like [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) or [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
   ﻿  2. Execute CLI commands at build time to generate example text (e.g. current software version numbers)
   ﻿  3. Use text processing tools to extract and use content from other files (e.g. source code)

  4. Automated testing and verification. For example:

    ﻿ 1. Use [Vale](https://vale.sh) to validate text against machine readable style guides
   ﻿  2. Use [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral) or [Redocly](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/lint/)

  5. [Continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), using static site generators (for example [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)). Note: This process is optional
