  **State the question**: “Is everyone okay with Indian food for dinner?’


  **Count**: 1, 2, 3, vote! Everyone votes at the same time and hands must be held high. This may seem trivial but, for more contentious topics (although this could be one), it is important that people do not look to others in the room to see how to vote.


  *Each person votes by holding up 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 fingers.*


  *The facilitator (or vote caller) looks around the room and quickly tallies the votes.  The votes breakdown like this:*


  **0 fingers (a fist)**: No way, terrible choice, I will not go along with it. A way to block consensus.


  **1 finger**: I have serious reservations with this idea, but I vote to move forward, but I’d prefer to resolve the concerns before supporting it.


  **2 fingers**: I have some concerns, but I’ll go along and try it.


  **3 fingers**: I will support the idea.


  **4 fingers**: I like this idea, sounds good.


  **5 fingers**: Absolutely, best idea ever! I’ll champion it.


  Based on the goal of the vote (as noted above), the facilitator takes the next steps…


  **Goal**: Check-in — The facilitator uses the results to adjust the session, make changes, start a discussion, or other actions based on how the vote went and how he/she sees the process progressing. Was the vote what you expected? Different? Do you believe changes are required?


  **Goal**: Learn and gain consensus — If you have some 0s, 1s, or 2s, ask for reasons. What reservations do they have? You ask for a brief summary or a bottom-line of the reasons. Ask for other bottom-line comment from others. Then call another vote. You may learn new information to restate the question and vote again.


  **Goal**: Vote and move forward — If everyone has fingers up, that is a yes. If everyone has a fist up, that is a clear no. If there is a mix, it is a winner take all, number of hands with fists, vs. number of hands with fingers up (1 thru 5).
