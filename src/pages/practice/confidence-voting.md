  * A facilitator will conduct the vote. As a topic discussion concludes, the
  facilitator will ask the participants to vote how confident they are on
  understanding the topic, the ability to execute, and sufficent resources and
  time.


  * At the count of 3, all participants will raise their hand and raise fingers
  indicating their confidence: 1 for low, 5 for high and 2, 3 or 4 for anything
  in between.


  *  In the end the facilitator will count the votes and open a discussion on
  what is yet to be cleared or addressed before moving on to the next topic.
howTo: >-
  **State the question**: “Is everyone okay with Indian food for dinner?’


  **Count**: 1, 2, 3, vote! Everyone votes at the same time and hands must be
  held high. This may seem trivial but, for more contentious topics (although
  this could be one), it is important that people do not look to others in the
  room to see how to vote.


  *Each person votes by holding up 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 fingers.*


  *The facilitator (or vote caller) looks around the room and quickly tallies
  the votes.  The votes breakdown like this:*


  **0 fingers (a fist)**: No way, terrible choice, I will not go along with it.
  A way to block consensus.


  **1 finger**: I have serious reservations with this idea, but I vote to move
  forward, but I’d prefer to resolve the concerns before supporting it.


  **2 fingers**: I have some concerns, but I’ll go along and try it.


  **3 fingers**: I will support the idea.


  **4 fingers**: I like this idea, sounds good.


  **5 fingers**: Absolutely, best idea ever! I’ll champion it.


  Based on the goal of the vote (as noted above), the facilitator takes the next
  steps…


  **Goal**: Check-in — The facilitator uses the results to adjust the session,
  make changes, start a discussion, or other actions based on how the vote went
  and how he/she sees the process progressing. Was the vote what you expected?
  Different? Do you believe changes are required?


  **Goal**: Learn and gain consensus — If you have some 0s, 1s, or 2s, ask for
  reasons. What reservations do they have? You ask for a brief summary or a
  bottom-line of the reasons. Ask for other bottom-line comment from others.
  Then call another vote. You may learn new information to restate the question
  and vote again.


  **Goal**: Vote and move forward — If everyone has fingers up, that is a yes.
  If everyone has a fist up, that is a clear no. If there is a mix, it is a
  winner take all, number of hands with fists, vs. number of hands with fingers
  up (1 thru 5).
