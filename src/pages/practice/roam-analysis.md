  Things do not always go to plan.  ROAM analysis is a framework for identifying
  and addressing risks.


  ROAM analysis is scalable and can be used for individual teams as well as large programs of work.
whyDo: >-
  Identifying and managing risks helps teams to eliminate or reduce risk impact
  to team goals.  


  Not all risks are the same.   ROAM analysis is particularly useful for categorizing risks and developing a suitable action plan.
howTo: >-
  **Triggers for ROAM Analysis**


  * Retrospectives

  * Sprint and/or Program Planning


  **How to Start**


  1. Begin this practice at the end of a team ceremony where risks may be identified (ex. retrospective, sprint planning, program planning, etc.)

  2. Use brainwriting to engage the entire audience and populate a list of "risks" to the team (use affinity mapping to consolidate similar ideas.)

  3. Review risks and discuss options.  Can the risk be:

     * **R**esolved: Sometimes simply raising a risk improves communication and risks may be found to no longer exist.  
     * **O**wned: Additional work is required to mitigate or eliminate some risks.   *(These are the most important risks to identify.)*
     * **A**ccepted: Minor impact risks or risks with no alternatives may just need to be accepted.  
     * **M**itigated: By taking a different approach, the impact of some risks can be decreased.  The remaining impact is limited enough for the team to accept.
  4. Before concluding, review the list of "owned" risks to ensure an owner has been identified to follow up on how to address these risks.


  **Materials Needed**


  * In person: whiteboard, post-its, markers

  * Virtual: a virtual whiteboard tool like miro or Mural would be idea to allow for full group brainwriting


  **OPTIONAL: Start with Risk Mapping**


  It may be helpful to plot out newly identified risks on a chart with Impact and Likelihood as the main axes.  Risks with low scores should likely be accepted.  Risks with higher impact and/or likelihood should be owned or mitigated.
