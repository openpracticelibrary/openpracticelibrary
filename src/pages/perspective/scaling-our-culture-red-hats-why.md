## What is it?

Last year, Red Hat embarked on a journey to articulate our company's "Why"—our highest level reason for existing in the world. We followed an open and inclusive process that engaged more than 10,000 Red Hatters.

## Why use it?

Simon Sinek, author, Find Your Why: A Practical Guide for Discovering Purpose for You and Your Team,  points out that many say why is particularly important during moments of uncertainty, but the reality is that things are always uncertain. Unless you begin with the end in mind by starting with why, you will get obsessed with daily metrics. The daily gets us sidetracked from the long game.

Red Hat's Why **:** 

"Open unlocks the world's potential" 

\- to share knowledge and build upon each other’s discoveries.

\- to solve complex problems, by bringing passionate people together to collaborate. 

\- to create communities where everyone is fully supported to use their voices and talents to contribute.
