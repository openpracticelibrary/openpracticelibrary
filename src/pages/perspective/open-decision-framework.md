## What is it?

The Open Decision Framework describes a process for making transparent, inclusive decisions in organisations that embrace open source principles. It  brings together ideas and best practices from across the organisation into a flexible tool that helps you make better business decisions.

Growing and sustaining an open organisation can be challenging. One tool that's being developed and tested is the Open Decision Framework, a collection of best practices for applying open source principles to business projects and decisions.

## Why use it?

The Open Decision Framework contains the collective wisdom of practitioners of open principles, compiled into a flexible framework that helps decision makers and leaders seek out diverse perspectives and collaborate across teams and geographic areas, to make better decisions.

You can use the Open Decision Framework with your teams today! Simply download copies available online.
