## What is it?

* A practice that focuses development on products and associated business outcomes of those products.
* Primarily product ownership is about enabling a collaboration between development teams members of a product and all the stakeholders, users and any affected by that product.
* Supported by many other practices to maximise and prioritise business and customer value of features incrementally built into products.



## Why use it?

* Facilitates a connection between development teams and the products that deliver business and customer value.
* Provides a strong foundation for long lived cross functional teams to iteratively discovery and deliver increments of the product releasing value early and often.
* Enables a flexible and adaptive approach to delivering products that can be responsive to feedback and the market.
