Below you can find a list of recommended hardware, tips for improving your environment, good principles for online collaboration and the minimum technical requirements for having a good remote working experience. Check it out

## Further Information

> ## Preparations:

**Team shopping list for home work accessories**

* Agree collaboratively what is needed from equipment, environment, health, security and so on. 

**Conduct workstation and safety assessment:**  

* It is advisable to  conduct a safety assessment check and attend any relevant training provided by your employer.  Best to reach out HR and your manager.  This process helps identify any special requirement for any team member. For e.g: users with disability or risks.  
* You can use the  [DES workstation checklist](https://www.hse.gov.uk/msd/dse/assessment.htm) to help make an assessment. 

## Environment setup:

**Desk**

* There are a few options for types of desks that you can buy, and it really just comes down to your preference or your line of work. We recommend at least a 60x135cm desk size for a good starting point. For a healthier option, consider an adjustable laptop desk or stand desks.

**Ergonomic Office Chair**  

* Even though sitting doesn't require as much physical effort as standing, it still puts undue stress on your lower back. Combine the effects of a sedentary lifestyle with sitting all day and it can lead to various health problems.

**Adequate Lighting**

* With desk or floor lamps, dimmable if possible

**Storage**

* In order to keep the place tidy, you will need somewhere to store your supplies, such as pens, paper, sticky notes, ink, and business cards.
* Suitable home workspace that supports productivity. The space should be quiet, free from distraction, with deskware that is comfortable for the required working hours. Screen reader support enabled.

* If you have a specific need on a chair, desk due to certain health issues e.g: back pain and require ergonomics chairs, standing desk then reach out to your manager or HR team members.

**Try desk exercise**

* Working from home can be demanding at times with sitting on a desk for 8 hours a day for five days is not healthy.
* Consider some [desk exercise](https://snacknation.com/blog/office-exercises/), [osteopath stretches](https://www.posturepeople.co.uk/ask-an-osteopath-the-best-stretches-when-working-from-home/), yoga on a regular basis.

**Stress and Mental Health**

* Being siloed can make it difficult to get the support from your team and managers.
* Consider schedule 1-2-1 with your manager and team members.

Tips: Try practices like daily standup, retrospectives and put some social considerations for e.g: team virtual movie night, quiz night and put it as a priority  in your social contract.

## Others:

**Security**

* Ensure your home internet router password is long and strong
* 2 factor authentication device (eg. [yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/))
* When accessing customers applications or systems, it is important that the communication between devices is secure, either using protocols that encrypt the data such as HTTPS or using a corporate VPN.
* Always use the supported corporate VPN access software client if available

**Access**

In order to prepare properly for a remote delivery, we should ensure to have:

* Reliable access to Internet and sufficient bandwidth
* Credentials to VP, if applicable
* zTest connection to video conference tool both on and off VPN
* Test connection to the tools you are planning to use in the remote sessions.

Developers additionally should:

* Test connectivity to code repositories
* Test connectivity to applicable products (OpenShift, etc)
* Test connectivity for IDE to run remote pairing.

**Privilege & permissions**  

* Enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege** by granting only the minimum permissions required by an end user, application, service, task or system to perform the jobs they have been assigned if you are not using customer tools and procedures 
* Depending on the tools required for the engagement you will need to get the right access to the tools selected on the project. For all access requests you should contact your local Project Manager / Coordinator or Service Delivery Manager that will give you the required authorizations

**Time Management**  

* Better to have a time management tools in place
* Allocate home and work priorities in the backlog e.g: kids school pick up, shopping and meetings E.g: post-its, white board, google calendar might help
