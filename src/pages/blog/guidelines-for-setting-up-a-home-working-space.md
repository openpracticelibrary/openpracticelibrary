## Environment setup:

**Desk**

## Others:

* Ensure your home internet router password is long and strong
* 2 factor authentication device (eg. [yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/))
* When accessing customers applications or systems, it is important that the communication between devices is secure, either using protocols that encrypt the data such as HTTPS or using a corporate VPN.
* Always use the supported corporate VPN access software client if available

**Access**

In order to prepare properly for a remote delivery, we should ensure to have:

* Reliable access to Internet and sufficient bandwidth
* Credentials to VP, if applicable

Developers additionally should:

* Test connectivity to code repositories
* Test connectivity to applicable products (OpenShift, etc)
* Test connectivity for IDE to run remote pairing.

**Privilege & permissions**

* Enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege** by granting only the minimum permissions required by an end user, application, service, task or system to perform the jobs they have been assigned if you are not using customer tools and procedures
* Depending on the tools required for the engagement you will need to get the right access to the tools selected on the project. For all access requests you should contact your local Project Manager / Coordinator or Service Delivery Manager that will give you the required authorizations

**Time Management**

* Better to have a time management tools in place
* Allocate home and work priorities in the backlog e.g: kids school pick up, shopping and meetings E.g: post-its, white board, google calendar might help
