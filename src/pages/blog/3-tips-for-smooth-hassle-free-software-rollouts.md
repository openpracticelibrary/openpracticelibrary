Workers of all ages and experience levels struggle with software rollouts, which makes implementing new technologies a challenge for many business owners. Some employees approach [new software systems](https://www.ezcomputersolutions.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-upgrading-your-business-software/) with open arms, while others would prefer to use familiar programs for as long as they can.

Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to ensure your next software rollout will be a success. These tips from [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/) will help to simplify software rollouts and get employees up to speed in as little time as possible, so read on to learn more!



# **Highlight the Benefits**

[Change](https://www.situationmanagementsystems.com/blog/index.php/influence-skills-2/why-change-is-good-for-the-workplace/) in the workplace is something that many of us struggle with, but it’s often easier if we’re familiar with the ways in which we can benefit from the changes taking place. As such, it’s important to share these benefits with our employees — and let them know how a new software program could make their jobs better (and easier). Avoid focusing on how the change could improve the company as a whole, and instead highlight the benefits employees can expect to see by learning and implementing the new software system.



# **Adopt an ERP System**

When upgrading your software programs, an ERP system is just one type of tool you’ll want to think about adopting. Also known as [Enterprise Resource Planning](https://www.121ecommerce.com/resources/blog/top-signs-that-your-business-needs-an-erp-system/) (ERP) tools, these software systems can help you to stay organized and make smarter financial decisions — especially as your company grows and you update your business technologies. Expanding companies need software systems to manage their accounting, planning, and other business processes, and this is where an ERP tool comes into play.

As you shop around for the right business software for [enterprise resource planning](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/desktop/enterprise/erp/#overview), QuickBooks Enterprise is one option you’ll want to consider. While the program is quite robust, it’s much simpler to use than many larger ERPs. Plus, it can be used for everything from managing and running payroll to tracking inventory and running reports.



# **Train Employees**

In addition to adopting an ERP system and talking to your employees about the benefits of implementing a new software program, you’ll need to start thinking about how you’ll train your workers when the software goes live. The team at [Training Folks](https://www.trainingfolks.com/blog/5-tips-for-new-software-implementation-training-success) offers the following tips:

* Hire an instructional designer with experience using the new software system
* Conduct a [Training Needs Analysis](https://www.learnupon.com/blog/training-needs-analysis/) to identify your needs, budget, and goals
* Provide workers with access to the software before training actually begins
* Incorporate a variety of support materials into your training strategy, including handbooks, posters, and videos
* Ensure day-to-day scenarios are covered during training sessions and are included in training materials

Furthermore, it’s important to give employees plenty of time to plan for the transition — and offer ongoing training and support as workers begin to use your new software programs. After you’ve rolled out the new software, it’s also a good idea to check in with your workers and measure user analytics — as this will help you to improve the training experience and meet the needs of your employees. Check out the [WalkMe Blog](https://blog.walkme.com/how-to-measure-digital-adoption/) for some tips on measuring, tracking, and improving digital adoption within your organization.

There are pros and cons of upgrading your software systems, with one of the disadvantages being the length of time it takes to train your employees for new software rollouts. However, new software programs can help to make employees much more productive and efficient — while also streamlining business processes and saving your company time and money. Software implementations can be a major pain, but these three tips will help to make your next big rollout a huge success!
