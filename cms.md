# CMS instructions

This documentation covers using Netlify CMS to write content. This feature is in limited testing and not widely available just yet. Stay tuned!

## Adding Content (Content Writers)
### Pre-requisites
#### Github
To create or edit a practice, you will need a [Github](https://github.com) account. You don't need to have any content in Github as it is only used for authentication purposes.

#### Template
A simple template is shown below which contains some example headers for use within the practice library.

|Header|Comment|
|----------------|--------|
|What is it?| A brief description of the practice|
|Why use it?| A short paragraph describing the use case(s) for the use of this practice. |
|How does it fit? | Relevant section(s) of the Open Practice Library for which this practice can be used|
|Who do you need?| A list of personas or roles required to run the practice.|
|Suggested Time| A rough idea of how long it will take to complete this practice.  Some practices can be quite short (such as the Daily Standup which will only last 10-15 minutes)|
|Difficulty| From the point of view of facilitator and participants, how hard is this practice? A simple "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" will suffice.|
|Materials Needed|What materials are required to run the practice? For example, a large whiteboard, sticky notes, whiteboard markers etc|
|How to use|A step-by-step guide on how to run the practice|
|Related Practices| Which practices can be used in conjunction, before or after this practice|

### Creating Content

<b>Before you continue, please check the Pre-Requisites above (for example, that you have a valid GitHub.com account)</b>

We are using [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to update this content.

- Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://quirky-benz-f1ebba.netlify.com/admin/">Netifly Admin Page </a> and click "Login with Netifly Identity".
- Select "Continue with GitHub" and enter your Github credentials.
- Click "New Practices".
- Fill in the Title with the name of your Practice.  Leave the publish date as is.
- You can either use Rich Text or Markdown format for the content.  Rich Text could be easier for non-technical people and you can use the style icons at the top of the Body section to add headers and formatting.

Once you have added your content, click the blue "Save" button at the top of the screen.

Change the Status to "In Review".

This will raise a pull request on the underlying Github repository which can then be actioned by one of the site moderators.  

<b>If you try to publish the Practice yourself, you will see an error as it needs to be curated by a moderator.</b>

<b>You will receive emails once the content has been actioned. </b>

These actions could be to add/change or content if everything is good, you will receive and email saying that the content has been merged (accepted in to the library).

### Editing Content
You can use the first steps in the above workflow to edit content.  Select the practice you wish edit.  Don't forget to update the date and click "Save" once you have edited the content.  

An email will be sent to the moderators who will approve the change.

## Publishing Content (Moderators)
As a moderator, you will receive and email to say that new content has been added:
