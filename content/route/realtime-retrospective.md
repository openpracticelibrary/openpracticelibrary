# Realtime Retrospective

## What is it?

The Realtime Retrospective technique was created by Emily Webber[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) in the UK. This is a great way to capture feedback from a large number of participants in realtime over an extended period of time. By the middle/end of the Realtime Retrospective you should have:

- Feedback in a timeline like fashion that are both positive and negative things
- A capture of the mood and reaction of people over the course of time in a realtime manner
- Lots of sticky notes on a wall


## Why use Realtime Retrospective?

- Let's face it, nobody *likes* filling out surveys, especially if it's more than 3 questions. Why not have them write unfiltered, uncensored, and quick feedback at the time they think of it? Realtime Retrospectives provide a low bar of entry and is voluntary and easy to participate anonymously.
- For long running days or weeks with multiple sessions/activities, you can visibly see people's moods or grasp of the information in realtime
- When running similar sessions in quick succession, you may need to improve quickly and sometimes adjust on the fly.


## Related Practices

- Timeline Retrospectives by Patrick Kua[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) uses a similar approach to gathering feedback in a sequential order
- Linda Rising has a concept of the Continuous Retrospective[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3) that uses the timeline aspect of the Timeline Retrospective and to reflect on it everyday as a team.


## Who do you need?

- "Facilitator" (Person to setup/cleanup)
- People (anybody that was there during the timeframe)


## Suggested Time

- ~10 Minutes setting up and cleaning up
- Wall is kept up over the course of 1-5 days for active participation


## Difficultly
- Facilitator: Easy
- Participants: Easy


## Facilitation Materials Needed
- Drawing paper roll[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise
- 8x6 sticky notes[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5)
- At least 3 different colors of small 3x3 square sticky notes[<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6)
- Markers
- Painters Tape


## Process Phase
Realtime Retrospectives are a great way to reflect back and could be used during most any phase of the Double Diamond[<sup>7</sup>](#footnote-7) model.
