## What is it?

Event Storming is a rapid, interactive approach to business process discovery and design that yields high quality models. It was introduced in a blog by Alberto Brandolini[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) in 2013. At the end of the event storm, you should have:

- A shared understand of the business process you are building as part of the project, including:
  - which steps should be considered in scope and which steps are out of scope
  - the users involved in the process
  - an initial inventory of UI screens for the process
  - an initial inventory of Aggregates[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)
- A physical diagram with the above information, which can be transferred to a digital format


## Why use Event Storming?

- It is significantly faster, and a heck of a lot more fun, than traditional process modeling techniques. You'll be surprised how much you accomplish in a short period
- The technique is iterative, which allows facilitators to:
  - slowly adding more detail in each session as to not overwhelm participants.
  - pick and choose participants by session
  - provide cognitive breaks (participants will get tired)
- It forces important questions about the customer journey early in the ideation process
- It gives you the big picture of the solution by placing technical implementation details in context of the business process
- It is particularly effective way to kick start Domain Driven Design[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3)


## Related Practices

- [User Story Mapping](/practices/user-story-mapping/) is a great way to create an Agile delivery plan for a business process designed with Event Storming
- Journey Mapping[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4) can provide a high level overview of the business process before using Event Storming to get into the details
- Event Storming will identify key views for your user interface, which can jump start Site Mapping[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) or Wireframing[<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6)


## Who do you need?

- Facilitator
- Product Owner
- User Experience Design
- Analysts
- Developers
- Testers (optional but recommended)


## Suggested Time

- ~6 Hours not including breaks
- Facilitate in small sessions @ around ~90 minutes each
- Session can be done on different days


## Difficulty
- Facilitator: Moderate
- Participants: Easy


## Facilitation Materials Needed

- Drawing paper roll[<sup>7</sup>](#footnote-7). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise.
- 2 different colors of wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes[<sup>8</sup>](#footnote-8)
- 4 different colors of small square sticky notes like the 3x3 sticky notes[<sup>9</sup>](#footnote-9)
- Permanent Markers for the stickies
- Whiteboard markers if you use whiteboard roll, or charcoal pencils if you use drawing paper. Theses are useful to jot adhoc lines/arrows/annotations



## How does it fit?

- Typically done in the Outcomes area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library
