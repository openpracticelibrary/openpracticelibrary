## What is it?

An empathy map is a collaborative tool used to develop insight into customers, users, etc.. It is often a starting point for gaining empathy for the people a team is solving problems for. Like a persona, an empathy map can represent a group of people, such as a user or customer segment.

* A way to form a better understanding of users and build personas
* The information is captured as a brainstorm for a team to develop assumptions about the people 
* The information can also be directly added from interviews, observation and other facilitated conversation exercises
* Senses captured can include what the person is seeing, thinking, doing and feeling with information captured on a big visible chart

## When to use it?

This tool can be used at various times in the product lifecycle. If there is a need to gain new understanding about people that have an impact on the growth or use of an application, this may be a good time to consider an empathy map. Particularly when first learning about new customers, users, or stakeholders.

* A tool to identify pain points, opportunities and starts to form a basis for improvement and optimization
* Captures information and learning directly from the end user or customer effected by the system/application/solution in question
* Enables a direct connection between important stakeholders and the product team (for example, developers of an application can learn directly from end users using it)

## Facilitation Tips

Prepare the team by letting them know this activity seeks to gain empathy for the 'human' solving a particular problem for. Let everyone know they are there to step into the shoes of the user, customer, etc.. 

* For an immersive activity, use large craft paper or a whiteboard to draw the map
* Have everyone write on sticky notes to develop their assumptions around the map
* Make sure to use different color sticky notes to represent different ideas from the team
* If using to collect feedback from a interview session, the same can be done with sticky notes
* Make sure to include a representation of the face in the middle of the map (this should differ based on the pain points)
* Give your empathy map a name! Similar to a persona it is easier to make a human connection when a name is added
