## What is it?

This Design Thinking practice is exactly what the title says - the team members have to imagine the box/packaging for a new product. They need to come up with slogans that correspond to the essence of the product/service, highlight the most important valuable features it aims at. 

It gets the team to think from a big picture perspective and from the shoes of the potential customers and to start designing a new product/service.

In different formats you may either start with a blank box or provide carton to  participants and ask them to design the box in the process.



## Why use it?

* Helps translate vision into a set of characteristics to describe how it would feel and look when achieved
* It allows to easily articulate the product/service goal
* Allows the team to think big without the constraints of the present and the context they are in or where they are coming from
* Serves as a stepping stone to Value Proposition or Lean Canvas by articulating some of the most important use cases, features and benefits.
* Provides really good input for the goal to be used in Impact Mapping



## Why & How to combine it with other practices?

* This practice is really helpful if you find it hard to articulate the goal during an Impact Mapping session. It can help articulate product vision and ambitions
* It is also a good transition from a vision into a more concrete description of expected product/service design, e.g. through Event Storming
* It can provide interesting input for Value Proposition and Lean Canvas
