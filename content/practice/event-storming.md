## What is Event Storming?

Event Storming is a rapid, interactive approach to business process discovery and design that yields high quality models. It was introduced in a blog by Alberto Brandolini[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) in 2013. At the end of the event storm, you should have:

* A shared understanding of the business process you are building as part of the project, including:

  * which steps should be considered in scope and which steps are out of scope
  * the users involved in the process
  * an initial inventory of UI screens for the process
  * an initial inventory of Aggregates[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)
* A physical diagram with the above information, which can be transferred to a digital format

**Learn more by listening to the Open Practice Podcast episode üéôÔ∏è**

## Why use Event Storming?

* It is significantly faster, and a heck of a lot more fun, than traditional process modeling techniques. You'll be surprised how much you accomplish in a short period
* It establishes a common and shared language between Business & IT
* It sets focus in terms of scope and boundaries
* The technique is iterative, which allows facilitators to:

  * slowly adding more detail in each session as to not overwhelm participants.
  * pick and choose participants by session
  * provide cognitive breaks (participants will get tired)
* It forces important questions about the customer journey early in the ideation process
* It gives you the big picture of the solution by placing technical implementation details in context of the business process
* It is particularly effective way to kick start Domain Driven Design[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3)

## How to do Event Storming?

* Business Team maps out the Business Process from a Users perspective
* The Best way is to start with the 'happy scenario', where the User successful reaches their goal (eg Student buys movie tickets online)
* In addition, the Business Team identifies which data is required in order to make the business flow successful (eg Movie Name, Session Time, Student discounted price)
* Once the Business Process has been defined, the IT team will join to provide additional information in forms of Events, Data and User Interfaces. This will establish a shared understanding of what is required
* The architect will start grouping common objects in order to define the microservices to be developed

## Related Practices

* [User Story Mapping](/practice/user-story-mapping/) is a great way to create an Agile delivery plan for a business process designed with Event Storming
* Journey Mapping[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4) can provide a high level overview of the business process before using Event Storming to get into the details
* Event Storming will identify key views for your user interface, which can jump start Site Mapping[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) or Wireframing[<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6)

## Facilitation Materials Needed

* Drawing paper roll[<sup>7</sup>](#footnote-7). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise.
* 2 different colors of wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes[<sup>8</sup>](#footnote-8)
* 4 different colors of small square sticky notes like the 3x3 sticky notes[<sup>9</sup>](#footnote-9)
* Permanent Markers for the stickies
* Whiteboard markers if you use whiteboard roll, or charcoal pencils if you use drawing paper. Theses are useful to jot adhoc lines/arrows/annotations
