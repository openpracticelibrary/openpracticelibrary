## What is proto-persona?

Proto-personas in Lean UX are like personas but without validation through months of lengthy expensive research studies. This is a ad-hoc persona created by need to begin work on a product immediately, not spending too much time in research. These personas are built with assumptions with knowledge of team and stakeholders. Over the course of the project, the proto-persona can be updated more accurately to reflect the user with what we learn throughout the process. For e.g: survey, user interview, usability testing and so on.

## Why use proto-persona?

* **Shared understanding:**\
  This process helps everyone in the team to build a common vocabulary of the users they will design and develop. As a result decision making will be easier and designing product will be more focused.
* **Decision Making:**\
  Having a clearly stated persona attributes also helps in decision making quicker. This will help prioritizing and agree on which feature will be more beneficial for the well defined personas.
* **Focus:**\
  Helps the team focus on the external customer/ users instead and not confuse the user as one of them from the team.
* **Avoid risky knowledge gap:**\
  There is a risk in knowledge gap between the team who creates persona and who uses them for e.g: external research team and the team working on the project. There is a risk of not learning about users throughout the product design cycle. In Lean UX approach, the team creates the proto-persona together and validates them throughout their learnings.
* **Iterative approach:**\
  In Lean UX, persona is not one-time activity whereas the persona goes through multiple iterative process through learnings.
* **Recruiting correct user type for usability testing:**\
  This also helps in prioritizing for future usability testing on the focus user groups to validate the assumptions.
