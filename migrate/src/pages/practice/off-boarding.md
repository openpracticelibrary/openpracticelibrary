## What is it?

Using [Everything-as-Code](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/everything-as-code/) by putting all infrastructure and configuration data into code, applications can be deployed in a repeatable and reliable fashion. Put it into action! Deploy code in one environment, and then re-deploy into another environment.  Or destroy the first one and re-deploy :D

Practice on a cadence (1-3 weeks) in order to catch all the bugs! Keep repeating until all the bugs are caught! It gets easier each time, and everyone on the team should practice it for a shared understanding.

## Why use it?

To build resiliency and reliability for the automation of code deployment, thus resulting in less downtime and more throughput.
