# Discovery Session

## What is it?

A [discovery session](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/discovery-session-consulting-datasheet) is a standard part of the Red Hat Consulting Solution Delivery Framework, which is is used to elicit the necessary information to craft an approach describing the way Red Hat should engage with our customer. A successful discovery session sghould result in at least the following:

1. A shared understanding of [a problem statement](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/2-problem-statement/) the team will be addressing. You don't necessarily need this format written down, but you should have enough information that you could present it back to the team and be met with agreement.
2. A prioritized list of [assumptions](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/3-identify-assumptions/) to test as part of residency. These should capture the way an actor (i.e. customer/developer/test/ops) needs to change their behavior (i.e. do more or less of something) in order to achieve a solution to the problem statement.
3. A shared understanding of the type of residency the team wants to use to test their hypotheses (e.g. [explore, transform, disrupt](https://youtu.be/G2_rw69ICWk?t=10m))
4. The types of people we would need in order to test these assumptions in a residency and whether Red Hat and/or the customer should provide the skills set (e.g. UI focused projects need a designer)
5. Any major constraints that would fundamentally alter the way we could test the assumptions (e.g. major technology choices for databases or app dev frameworks, travel restrictions, availability of employee skill sets, releases, preferences on cloud providers etc.)
