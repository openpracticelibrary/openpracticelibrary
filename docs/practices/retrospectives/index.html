<h2 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h2>

<p>Retrospectives provide opportunities for groups to reflect, inspect and adapt their ways of working. They often take place at the end of sprints but can be scheduled at any time.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-retrospectives">Why use Retrospectives?</h2>

<p>Retrospectives facilitate continous improvement. Rather than wait until the end of a project to run a full &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; exercise for the entire delivery, we encourage taking short time boxes during delivery for the team to course correct and find ways to improve their way of working.</p>

<h2 id="related-practices">Related Practices</h2>

<p>Many practices benefit from their artefacts being re-visited, reflected upon and/or updated during retrospectives including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/social-contract/">Social Contract</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/team-sentiment/">Team Sentiment</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/burndown/">Burndown Charts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/visualisation-of-work/">Visualisation of Work</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Engineering practices such as Continuous Integration and Test Automation can also benefit from being considered during retrospectives. In particular, exporting data from associated tools to give teams the opportunity for the team to review the data, inspect trends and establish whether any adaption in behaviour or practice would enable them and measurements to improve.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/realtime-retrospective/">Realtime-Retrospective</a> is a very similar practice which runs continiously and captured fe edback in real time.</p>

<h2 id="who-do-you-need">Who do you need?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Facilitator</li>
<li>The Team</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="suggested-time">Suggested Time</h2>

<ul>
<li>Varies based on the duration of the time period the retrospective is covering. We recommend allowing 30-60 minuites for a one week sprint retrospective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>

<ul>
<li>Facilitator: Easy</li>
<li>Participants: Easy</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="facilitation-materials-needed">Facilitation Materials Needed</h2>

<p>There are lots of different formats retrospectives can take (see the references for links to some excellent resources which provide ideas). Typical materials used during facilitation include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flat space which will hold sticky notes</li>
<li>Stickies (preferably a wide variety)</li>
<li>Sharpie pens</li>
<li>White-board pens if using a white board or MagicWhiteboard paper</li>
<li>Clock for time boxing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process-phase">Process Phase</h2>

<p>Often run at the end of iterations / sprints on a rhythm (same time on same day) but can be run at any time.</p>
