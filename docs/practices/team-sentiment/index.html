<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>Team Sentiment practices track the mood of a team and provide a mechanism for team members to rapidly feed back, either publically or anonymously, when their mood has changed.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-team-sentiment-pratice">Why use a Team Sentiment pratice?</h2>

<p>Team sentiment practices enable problems to be identified, radiated and addressed early. They enable the team to quickly discuss where one or more team members is suddenly troubled by the direction their work is going and can also provide an information radiator to assess the overall team health and feeling.</p>

<p>Team sentiment practices are often introduced where there is a strong sense of servant leadership in the working environment.</p>

<h2 id="related-practices">Related Practices</h2>

<p>Where the team has used the <a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/social-contract/">Social Contract</a> practice, team sentiment practices can help enforce some of the feeling radiated in the Social Contract.</p>

<p><a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/realtime-retrospective/">Retrospectives</a> are excellent check-points on the team health and taking the opportunity to review the Team Sentiment artefcts can facilitate a team conversation as to how they can improve overall team mood and what has been learned in the recent iteration.</p>

<h2 id="who-do-you-need">Who do you need?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Someone to introduce and facilitate the team sentiment practice(s).</li>
<li>A cross functional team to continously use the practice. Multiple teams can each use their own practice and multiple resulting artefacts can be used to roll up and radiate wider organisational moood trends.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="suggested-time">Suggested Time</h2>

<ul>
<li>5-10 minutes to introduce and make first use of the practice.</li>
<li>Ad hoc updates performed on an ongoing basis (with facilitator driving the continuous adoption, use and value of the practice).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>

<ul>
<li>Facilitator - Medium</li>
<li>Participants - Easy</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-does-it-fit">How does it fit?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Typically done in the Culture and Collaboration area of the Foundation of the Open Practice Library</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="facilitation-materials-needed">Facilitation Materials Needed</h2>

<p>To use &ldquo;Mood Marbles&rdquo; as the Team Sentiment practice
- A number of containers to hold enough marbles (can be drawings of containers on large flip-chart paper)
- Red and Green Marbles (can be sticky notes) to start with. Other colors can be introduced.</p>

<h2 id="how-to">How To</h2>

<p>Mood Marble containers are placed in a straegic place where all team members will see and walk pass regularly (for example, near the door or on the way to the bathroom).</p>

<p>Team are encouraged to think about their current mood. Start with positive (green) and negative (red) and each team member adds a marble to the container that reflects their mood.</p>

<p>Team members are regularly reminded they can change their mood marble at any time.</p>
