<h2 id="goals-of-this-library">Goals of this Library</h2>

<p>While this is intended for everyone who has an interest in learning more about the Red Hat Open Innovation Labs processes and practices, this Open Practice Library has two main goals in mind.</p>

<h3 id="share-the-big-picture">Share the Big Picture</h3>

<p>Describe how Red Hat and Red Hat Open Innovation Labs use practices to accomplish engagement success. Learn how practices fit with each other and the way that we take individual Practices to create seamless engagement delivery.</p>

<h3 id="search-with-intent">Search with Intent</h3>

<p>Share details about a particular practice that Red Hat Open Innovation Labs uses. Know our perspective on a particular practice and why practices are used, pointers on how to facilitate it, and when it should be employed.</p>

<h3 id="we-hope-that-you-come-for-the-practices-and-stay-for-the-strategy-of-the-way-we-work-way-of-working">We hope that you come for the practices and stay for the strategy of <a href="https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/way-of-working/"><em>The Way We Work</em></a>.</h3>

<h2 id="what-this-library-is-not">What This Library Is <em>Not</em></h2>

<p>An exhaustive, detailed guide to apply these practices. We&rsquo;ve tried that, and folks tend to focus on the step by step instruction but miss the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; information. Or they just don&rsquo;t read the material, which we understand. Not everyone likes reading thousands of pages of method material like we do.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-library-is">What This Library <em>Is</em></h2>

<p>Just enough information for each practice to &ldquo;specify the end state, it’s purpose, and the minimum possible constraints&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;create alignment and enable autonomy&rdquo; for participants and facilitators. Where more detailed content is useful, we&rsquo;ll provide links. This idea comes from Donald Reinersten&rsquo;s <em>Principle of Mission</em>, which provides the conceptual foundation to <em>Lean Enterprise</em> by Jex Humble, Joanne Molesky &amp; Barry O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts about the material presented here or other content you&rsquo;d like to add. <a href="https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library/issues">Open an issue</a> and we can go from there.</p>

<p>Alternately, feel free to fork our <a href="https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library">github repo</a> and submit a PR of your proposed changes. We use markdown files for our base content that gets rendered for this site. For helpful development setup see our <a href="https://github.com/rht-labs/practice-library/blob/master/README.md">README</a></p>

<h2 id="style">Style</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re looking to be friendly and also authoritative, comprehensive and also concise. We use the active voice where possible to help guide teams to action. We don&rsquo;t always get it right, though. If you find something that could be clearer or punchier, feel free to send us a merge request!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-fit-these-practices-into-your-existing-approach">How to Fit These Practices into Your Existing Approach</h2>

<p>While we have our own approach to engagements, we understand that there might be an approach you are already following. So, we place each practice in the British Design Council&rsquo;s Double Diamond model. This is <a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond">originally documented here</a>, although <a href="https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812">we like this slightly broader and more detailed walk through</a>. The Double Diamond model is widely used and easily transferable to other Design Thinking models, so regardless of which approach you use, you should be able to see where each practice fits.</p>
