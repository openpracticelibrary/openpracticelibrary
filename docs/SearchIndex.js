{"title": " Impact Mapping", "url": "/practices/impact-mapping", "content": "\n## What is it?\n\nImpact Mapping is an engaging, graphical, strategic planning technique. It was introduced by Gojko Adzic in 2012. At the end of the impact map, you should have:\n\n- A shared understand of your effort's goal or problem statement\n- An inventory of human behavioral changes that must occur (or not occur) for your project to be successful. These are the impact from which the technique gets it name\n- Optionally, an inventory of project scope that could be delivered to achieve the aforementioned impacts\n- Some sort of prioritization of scope and/or impacts\n- A physical or digital diagram with the above information\n\n## Why use Impact Mapping?\n\n- Most planning activities revolve around juggling a \"shopping list of features,\" as Gojko calls them. Even though the features are delivered, often the business objective is not achieved. Impact Mapping reorients us towards delivering value, not delivering features.\n- Impact Mapping introduces a very simple human centered design process, and as such, it is a great way to put lightweight design thinking techniques into practice\n- It's a graphical mind map, which reduces the barrier to entry for participants and facilitators alike\n- The technique is highly adaptable, because the core mind map is so simple. Gojko's original text describes a ~4 week executive level strategic planning workshop. At Labs, we typical run a 4-6 hour session with Project Sponsors during a Discovery Session. These are just two of endless possible variations of the technique.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- [Start At The End](/practices/start-at-the-end/) is another practice which leads to the same outputs. Compared to Start At The End, Impact Mapping produces a higher fidelity understanding of the domain, but at the cost of increased complexity for facilitation. Generally speaking, Impact Mapping is the better fit when building products or services, and Start At The End is a better fit when discussing organizational change or other generally nebulous efforts. \n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Facilitator\n- Product Owner\n- Project Sponsor, both technical and business\n- Architects\n\n## Suggested Time\n\nFor the shortened variation Labs uses:\n\n- 2-4 hours of prep to establish a [goal or problem statement](/practices/why-is-defined/) _before_ the session. This is important, or your session will go sideways!\n- optionally - 2 hours before the session to create an outline of the Impact Map based on your current understanding, as a way to introduce the subject to participants\n- ~4 Hours to facilitate the session, not including breaks\n- Facilitate in small sessions @ around 60-90 minutes each\n- Session can be done on different days\n\nFor the executive level session format, see the Impact Mapping book[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1):\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator: Moderate\n- Participants: Easy\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nDigital Variation:\n\n- a mind mapping tool. we recommend coggle[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)\n\nPhysical Variation:\n\n- a large whiteboard\n- whiteboard markers\n- sticky notes\n- markers for stickies\n\n## Process Phase\n\nWhen run strategically, at senior levels, Impact Mapping is a great way to run the \"Define the Area to Focus Upon\" phase of the Double Diamond design model[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3). When applied more tactically, Impact Mapping can used as a transition from the first diamond to the second, largely as a way to synthesize strategy work down to date in an easy to consume format.\n\n## Additional Resources for Red Hatters (we're working to share more broadly)\n\n- Gojko Adzic's [original book in pdf format](https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-988976)\n- [Printouts to facilitate a session](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By2q4H1d4ahQS2M3UGVrZ0dtT2c)\n- [Facilitation Slides](https://docs.google.com/a/redhat.com/presentation/d/1xGRapKJtNFEUeY5mMT7Vrljd325wD8oPo9yOhU7mod4/edit?usp=sharing) using the Ambassadors Program as an example\n- Impact Mapping and Design Thinking [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1io_4_pUqhgjrlZotcTUF3se4Uu-9qQqlJKj1pHtx9Vc/edit#slide=id.g2542fa993d_0_0)\n\n## External Resources\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Gojko Adzic's [original book](https://www.impactmapping.org/book.html)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>Impact Mapping tool: [coggle](https://coggle.it/)\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>[Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812)\n4.

{"title": " User Story Mapping", "url": "/practices/user-story-mapping", "content": "\n## What is it?\n\nUser Story Mapping is an evolution of the traditional Agile backlog, made popular by Jeff Patton in 2008[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1). It's an effective practice for creating lightweight release plans that can drive standard Agile delivery practices. At the end of user story mapping, you should have:\n\n- A backlog of scope items (captured as stories or simply feature titles) the team believes can be delivered in the planning window. This means some items will be placed out of scope\n- The backlog \"sliced\" into ~3 iterations, such that it forms the outline of plan\n- Enough detail in the first iteration of the plan to get started with the work\n\n\n## Why use User Story Mapping?\n\n- No one likes estimating work effort, but it's an important step in many environments. User Story Mapping presents an approach to estimation that many teams find much more tolerable than practices like planning poker or t-shirt sizing\n- Many projects have a natural progression of work from beginning, middle to end. This progression is often lost in a traditional flat backlog. User Story Mapping captures this information with a lightweight mechanism to plan out more than one iteration (i.e. an Agile release plan)\n- User Story Mapping presents backlog items in the context of the overall business process so you don't lose sight of \"the big picture\", a common pitfall in Scrum projects\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- User Story Mapping is a great way to create an Agile delivery plan for a business process designed with [Event Storming](/practices/event-storming/)\n- Program Increment Planning[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) in Scaled Agile Framework leverages many of the ideas behind User Story Mapping\n- Site Mapping[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3) should provide the backbone of the User Story Map in UI driven projects\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Facilitator (if the team is new to the approach)\n- Product Owner\n- User Experience Design\n- Analysts\n- Developers\n- Testers\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- ~4 Hours not including breaks\n- Facilitate in small sessions @ around ~90 minutes each\n- Session can be done on different days\n\n\n## Difficulty\n- Facilitator: Easy\n- Participants: Easy\n\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n- Drawing paper roll[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4).

{"title": " Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM)", "url": "/practices/vsm-and-mbpm", "content": "\n## What is it?\n\nValue Stream Mapping (VSM) and Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM) are third generation lean process improvement techniques, optimized for an extended organizational transformation effort. They work in tandem, where VSM is designed to view the big, macro picture and make strategic decisions with executives, and MBPM is designed to view the detailed, micro picture and make tactical improvements with front line workers. The first generation of these techniques comes from Toyota's \"information and material flow\" (as documented in Lean Thinking[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) and the second generation from Learning to See[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2).\n\n## Why use VSM & MBPM?\n\nIn the context of software delivery, VSM & MBPM are excellent tools to holistically analyze and optimize \"brownfield\" delivery processes, including everything from requirements definition, infrastructure provisioning and application development.\n\nBeing derived from Lean Manufacturing, VSM & MBPM visually represent the way work flows through an organization, at both a macro and micro level, from the time a customer requests a good/service, until the time a customer receives the good/service. When used together, these tools are particularly effective at:\n\n- building shared understand throughout the various levels of an organization how work is actually done\n- creating the urgency for improvement\n- formulating specific, data driven improvement plans\n- preventing \"improvement\" work in a particular area that leads to sub-optimization for the entire value stream / process\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- In order to effectively deliver a session, it's critical you prepare with a [Chartering](/routes/chartering/) exercise\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- No more than 10 people\n- VSM requires decision makers, usually Director or above\n- MBPM requires front line workers for the processes being improved\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- Done as documented by Karen Martin, these are 2-3 day, dedicated workshops.\n- Labs team is currently working on more abbreviated formats that fit our delivery model\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator: Hard\n- Participants: Medium to Hard\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nSome teams prefer whiteboards, but the most common approach uses paper and PostIts\n\n- Drawing paper roll[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3).\n- Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4)\n- markers for the PostIts\n- charcoal pencil and eraser[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) to draw lines between PostIts\n- For MBPM; chalk line can be useful, but not required\n\n## Process Phase\n\nBoth VSM & MBPM document a current state map, and then design a future state map for subsequent implementation. Using the Double Diamond design model[<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6), the current state mapping takes us from the middle of the Discover stage to the middle of the Define stage, and the future state mapping takes us from the middle of the Define stage to the middle of Develop stage.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Start With\n\n- [Webinar](https://vimeo.com/149407030) and [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/KarenMartinGroup/vsmmbpmwhenyouoptforeach) from Karen Martin's Value Stream Mapping and Process Mapping: When to Use Each\n\n### VSM Specific Resources\n\n- [Book](https://www.ksmartin.com/books/value-stream-mapping/) by Karen Martin and Mike Osterling\n- [List of Webinars](https://www.ksmartin.com/webinar/value-stream-mapping/) by Karen Martin\n\n### MBPM Specific Resources\n\n- [Webinar](https://vimeo.com/54601924) and [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/KarenMartinGroup/metricsbased-process-mapping-what-when-how) from Karen Martin's Metrics-Based Process Mapping: What, When & How\n- [List of Webinars](https://www.ksmartin.com/webinar/metrics-based-process-mapping/) by Karen Martin\n\n## Additional Resources for Red Hatters (We're figuring out how to share these more broadly)\n\n- [Facilitation Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/redhat.com/presentation/d/1dtDYS83vUDn42wj5Mjik96N-NdEuofbX5_2il0p93L4/edit?usp=sharing) - Value Stream Mapping (VSM)\n- [Facilitation Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ijkm2zMLMiJ4KS_evA4ufug0fOL01QOEsxBsZ89_EdA/edit#slide=id.gb6f3e2d2d_2_207) - Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM)\n- [Software Delivery Example](https://app.bluescape.com/Bszck243FZrhMzcBVTTE?targetRect=%5B33678%2C4692%2C39053%2C10011%5D) - Bluescape with a VSM segment and 1 of 5 corresponding MBPM's\n\n## External References\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[Lean Thinking](https://www.lean.org/BookStore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductID=88)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Learning to See](https://www.lean.org/Bookstore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductId=9)\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>[Drawing Paper example](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80324072/)\n4. <a name=\"footnote-4\"></a>[4x6 sticky notes example](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-Janeiro-Collection-4621-SSAU/dp/B001UXFT70)\n5. <a name=\"footnote-5\"></a>[charcoal pencil and eraser example](https://www.amazon.com/Studio-25-Piece-Drawing-Artists-Charcoal/dp/1441310207)\n6. <a name=\"footnote-6\"></a>[Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812)\n", "draft": " false", "date": " 2017-09-12T00", "stages": " ['discovery', 'approach']"},

It looks to codify the behaviors and expectations of the team. It also provides a mechanism for the team to radiate and share its desired behaviours with management and other stakeholders. \n\nTo effectively use this practice you should look to create the following outcomes:\n\n- Public display of the social contract\n- Nobody is above the contract\n- The team agreed holds each other accountable to the contract. Having every team member physically sign the contract can provide a good starting point for this.\n- Revisit the social contract often and update it as necessary\n\n\n\n## Why use a Social Contract?\n\n- Quick means to clearly determine team dynamics and expectations\n- Promote autonomy and self governing of team behavior\n- The contract keeps the team consciously aware of how they work together\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- Collaborative Face Drawing[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) is a great ice breaker or after lunch activity.

The remaining work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. \n\nTeams often use burndown charts to track progress within fixed time periods (for example, Sprint Burndown charts). They can also be used to visualise progress for longer time periods and milestones (for example, Release Burndown charts).\n\n\n## Why use a Burndown chart?\n\nBurndown charts provide real data about a team's velocity and provides a mechanism as to whether the team's current velocity and trajectory will result in it meeting its committed goal(s).\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\n[Retrospectives](/practices/realtime-retrospective/) provide excellent opportunities to review recent burndown charts and to facilitate conversations on what can be learned from the data presented in them. \n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- A facilitator (such as a Scrum Master).\n- The full team who are responsible for delivering the work visualised on the chart.\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- 5-10 minutes to produce the base chart and introduce the practice.\n- Ad hoc updates performed on an ongoing basis (with facilitator driving the continuous adoption, use and value of the practice).\n\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator - Medium\n- Participants - Easy\n\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\n- A large piece of flip-chart paper - ideally with gridded lines.\n- Flip chart pens\n- Long ruler\n\n\n## Process Phase\n\n- Draw a horizonatal and vertical lines on the flip-chart\n- Mark the horizontal axis with the time measurement (for a Sprint Burndown, this is likely to be each day in the Sprint)\n- Mark the vertical axis with the work being measured (this may be number of tasks, number of stories/features, number of story points or estimated time)\n- Draw a diagonal line connecting the maximum work units to the last time measurement - this line represents the target/aspirational trend line\n- As work is complete, draw a line (in a differnt color) representing the time point the remaining work has 'burned down' and how much work is remaining\n- Re-visit and discuss what information the chart is radiating with the team and interested stakeholders.\n\n![Example Sprint Burndown](/images/burndown.png)\n\n## External References\n\n1.

{"title": " Agile Agenda", "url": "/practices/agile-agenda", "content": "\n## What is it?\n\nThe Agile Agenda is a simple, yet effective way to manage the agenda for an in person workshop using sticky notes and a whiteboard. The basic idea is draw a days calendar on to the whiteboard, split it into 2 or more tracks, write agenda items on sticky notes (with owners!) and then place them on the whiteboard in the correct time slot. Review your agenda in the morning, and then come back to it throughout the day, updating as need be. It should look something like this:\n\n![agile agenda](/images/agile_agenda.png)\n\n\n## Why use an Agile Agenda?\n\n- Sessions like [event storming](/practices/event-storming/) or [user story mapping](/practices/user-story-mapping/) don't neatly fit into time boxes. As such, you'll need to dynamic with the way you manage the agenda.\n- Whiteboards and stickies are easier to change than digital agendas which might need some formatting or even have access issues.\n- It works as an Information Radiator[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) throughout the workshop, making it a logical area to gather the team to review the agenda as well as do time checks.

A successful discovery session should result in at least the following:\n\n1. A shared understanding of [a problem statement](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/2-problem-statement/) the team will be addressing. You don't necessarily need this format written down, but you should have enough information that you could present it back to the team and be met with agreement.\n2. A prioritized list of [assumptions](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/3-identify-assumptions/) to test as part of residency. These should capture the way an actor (i.e. customer/developer/test/ops) needs to change their behavior (i.e. do more or less of something) in order to achieve a solution to the problem statement.\n3. A shared understanding of the type of residency the team wants to use to test their hypotheses (e.g. [explore, transform, disrupt](https://youtu.be/G2_rw69ICWk?t=10m))\n4. The types of people we would need in order to test these assumptions in a residency and whether Red Hat and/or the customer should provide the skills set (e.g. UI focused projects need a designer)\n5. Any major constraints that would fundamentally alter the way we could test the assumptions (e.g. major technology choices for databases or app dev frameworks, travel restrictions, availability of employee skill sets, releases, preferences on cloud providers etc.)\n\n\n## Why use a Discovery Session\n\nTODO\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\nTODO\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\nTODO\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\nTODO\n\n\n## Difficulty\n\nTODO\n\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nTODO\n\n\n## Process Phase\n\nTODO\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nTODO\n", "draft": " true", "date": " 2017-05-15T00", "stages": " ['discovery']"},
{"title": " Prep Week", "url": "/practices/prep-week", "content": "\n## What is it?\n\nThe Prep Week is a week of internal preparation before immediately before beginning a residency. It allows the team leading the engagement to immerse themselves in the particulars of the work before it kicks off. At the end of the prep week, you should have team consensus on:\n\n- what happened during discovery and the expectations the customer has for delivery\n- a bullet point agenda for the design week, with facilitators assigned for each item and a rough timeline\n- a process discovery and design technique (e.g. [event storming](/practices/event-storming/), [vsm or mbpm](/practices/vsm-and-mbpm/), etc)\n- the key characteristics of your backlog (e.g are you planning How Might We's or User Stories, will the backlog be sliced or rank prioritized)\n- the types of technologies that will be used, and in particular an assessment of what areas are high risk\n- the types of technical practices that will be used (e.g. Infrastructure as Code (IaC))\n- roles and responsibilities on the team\n- important logistics (e.g. flights / hotels / facilities / etc)\n\n## Why use a Prep Week?\n\n- Every residency is different. The series of conversations often takes the same progression (e.g. goals -> process -> delivery plan), but the level of abstraction and subject matter can vary greatly. We need time to tailor make the design week to the customer's needs.\n- The way of working in Open Innovation Labs can very different than way even experienced consultants are working. A prep week gives everyone a chase to set a common baseline before engaging the customer.\n- It affords a safe place for team building to begin.\n- It provides a chance to learn about technologies/methods that are new to some or all team members.\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Engagement Lead\n- Architect from the Discovery Session, even if they will not be responsible for delivery\n- All delivery personnel that will be full time and customer facing\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n4-5 days. In residencies that require a lot of technical unknowns or new/complicated methods, everyone should be collocated. In cases where the tech/method is well understood, the team can work remotely.\n\n## Difficulty\n\nEasy\n", "draft": " false", "date": " 2018-02-16T00", "stages": " ['approach']"},
{"date": " 2018-03-31T22", "url": "/practices/team-sentiment", "content": "\n\n## What is it?\n\nTeam Sentiment practices track the mood of a team and provide a mechanism for team members to rapidly feed back, either publically or anonymously, when their mood has changed.\n\n## Why use a Team Sentiment pratice?\n\nTeam sentiment practices enable problems to be identified, radiated and addressed early. They enable the team to quickly discuss where one or more team members is suddenly troubled by the direction their work is going and can also provide an information radiator to assess the overall team health and feeling. \n\nTeam sentiment practices are often introduced where there is a strong sense of servant leadership in the working environment. \n\n\n## Related Practices\n\nWhere the team has used the [Social Contract](/practices/social-contract/) practice, team sentiment practices can help enforce some of the feeling radiated in the Social Contract. \n\n[Retrospectives](/practices/realtime-retrospective/) are excellent check-points on the team health and taking the opportunity to review the Team Sentiment artefcts can facilitate a team conversation as to how they can improve overall team mood and what has been learned in the recent iteration.\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Someone to introduce and facilitate the team sentiment practice(s).\n- A cross functional team to continously use the practice. Multiple teams can each use their own practice and multiple resulting artefacts can be used to roll up and radiate wider organisational moood trends.\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- 5-10 minutes to introduce and make first use of the practice.\n- Ad hoc updates performed on an ongoing basis (with facilitator driving the continuous adoption, use and value of the practice).\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator - Medium\n- Participants - Easy\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nTo use \"Mood Marbles\" as the Team Sentiment practice\n- A number of containers to hold enough marbles (can be drawings of containers on large flip-chart paper)\n- Red and Green Marbles (can be sticky notes) to start with. Other colors can be introduced.\n\n## Process Phase\n\nMood Marble containers are placed in a straegic place where all team members will see and walk pass regularly (for example, near the door or on the way to the bathroom).\n\nTeam are encouraged to think about their current mood. Start with positive (green) and negative (red) and each team member adds a marble to the container that reflects their mood.\n\nTeam members are regularly reminded they can change their mood marble at any time.\n\n\n## External References\n\nDigital Mood Marble Board\n\n\n1.

{"date": " 2017-11-21T00", "url": "/practices/retrospectives", "content": "\n## What are they?\n\nRetrospectives provide opportunities for groups to reflect, inspect and adapt their ways of working. They often take place at the end of sprints but can be scheduled at any time.\n\n\n## Why use Retrospectives?\n\nRetrospectives facilitate continous improvement. Rather than wait until the end of a project to run a full \"lessons learned\" exercise for the entire delivery, we encourage taking short time boxes during delivery for the team to course correct and find ways to improve their way of working.\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\nMany practices benefit from their artefacts being re-visited, reflected upon and/or updated during retrospectives including:\n\n- [Social Contract](/practices/social-contract/)\n- [Team Sentiment](/practices/team-sentiment/)\n- [Burndown Charts](/practices/burndown/)\n- [Visualisation of Work](/practices/visualisation-of-work/)\n\nEngineering practices such as Continuous Integration and Test Automation can also benefit from being considered during retrospectives. In particular, exporting data from associated tools to give teams the opportunity for the team to review the data, inspect trends and establish whether any adaption in behaviour or practice would enable them and measurements to improve.\n\nThe [Realtime-Retrospective](/practices/realtime-retrospective/) is a very similar practice which runs continiously and captured fe edback in real time.\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Facilitator\n- The Team\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- Varies based on the duration of the time period the retrospective is covering.

{"date": " 2018-04-08T21", "url": "/practices/visualisation-of-work", "content": "\n## What is Visualisation of Work?\n\nThis practice involves radiating and visually representing all aspects of work. Information that is useful to team members, stakeholders and users is physically presented on walls, windows, doors and other flat surfaces and positioned in the line of sight of those people who will get value from consuming the information.\n\nThe \"Information Radiator\" is an artefact that is used to physically provide information to one or more people.\n\nThe activity of \"Walking the Walls\" is where someone interested in the work can walk around the physical space the associated team(s) are working from and get all the information they need from inspecting artefacts on the wall and from the resulting conversations.\n\n\n## Why Visualise work?\n\nVisualising work helps facilitate a transparent and open way of working. It helps avoid hiding information about status, progress, direction, challenges and opportunities related to a product. Traditionally such information is held in files on shared drives (for example, spreadsheets of project plans, powerpoint slides, word documents, etc.) which has the challenge of not being accessible or known about and, if found, not being up-to-date.\n\nWhere important information is constantly accessible and visible to people, both speed and accuracy of their work can improve with reduced wastage from having to search for information. It is also more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously being reminded of it.\n\n![Visualisation of Work](/images/visualisation-of-work.png)\n\n## Related Practices\n\nPractices we use that result in information radiators which we use to visualise work include:\n\n- [Impact Mapping](/practices/impact-mapping/)\n- [Event Storming](/practices/event-storming/)\n- [Value Stream Mapping and Metric Based Process Mapping](/practices/vsm-and-mbpm/)\n- Target Outcomes\n- [Social Contact](/practices/social-contract/)\n- [User Story Mapping](/practices/user-story-mapping/)\n- Product Backlogs\n- Sprint Boards\n- [Burndown](/practices/burndown/) and Burnup Charts\n- Build Monitors\n- CI/CD monitors\n- Retrospectives\n- [Realtime Retrospective](/practices/realtime-retrospective/)\n- [Team Sentiment](/practices/team-sentiment/)\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- A facilitator (such as a Scrum Master) to drive transparent ways of working.\n- The full team who are responsible for delivering the work visualised.\n- Interested stakeholders to consume information and feed back on it.\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- 5-10 minutes to produce each information radiator and start it radiating.\n- Ad hoc updates performed on an ongoing basis with the facilitator driving the continuous consumption of and feedback from the information being presented.\n\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator - Medium\n- Participants - Easy\n\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\n- Flip chart paper\n- Magic Whiteboard charts\n- Writable walls\n- Flip chart and white board pens\n- Stickie notes (all shapes, sizes and colors)\n- Sharpie pens\n- Large monitor / TV screens\n- Small computers to radiate dashboards (e.g. CI/CD monitors)\n\n\n## Process Phase\n\n- Consider the positioning of all information radiators and who will have line of sight\n- Consider use of color coding across different information radiators (for example, same color stickies to represent features)\n- Allow sufficient time to produce high quality information radiators that will inspire and drive interest\n- Introduce the information radiator to all those who will use it (either in contributing to it and/or consuming information from it)\n- Encourage continuous inspection and update to the information presented\n\n![Visualisation of Work](/images/visualisation-of-work2.png)\n\n## External References\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[Information Radiator by Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Information+radiator)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[98 Visualisation Examples by Jimmy Janl\u00e9n](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/9188063011/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n", "draft": " false", "title": " \"Visualisation of Work\""},
{"title": " Start At The End", "url": "/practices/start-at-the-end", "content": "\n## What is it?\n\nStart At The End is a simple exercise to identify a set of assumptions which must be tested in order achieve a long term goal. It's a rather simple exercise, which asks participants to describe what success looks like for their work, and use this to define the goal of the effort. We default to 12 months, but it can be longer or shorter. Then, the exercise asks participants to imagine all the ways their project can fail, and using the results to enumerate key questions or assumptions that must be examined at the start of the work. The technique is derived from Chapter 4 of The Sprint Book[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1). At the end of the exercise, you will have:\n\n- A shared understand of your effort's goal\n- A list of key questions or assumptions that need to be examined early in the work effort in order for the team to achieve the goal.\n- A prioritization of the key questions\n\n## Why use Start At The End?\n\n- Most planning activities revolve around juggling a \"shopping list of features,\" as Gojko Adzic calls them in [Impact Mapping](/practices/impact-mapping/). Even though the features are delivered, often the business objective is not achieved. Start At The End gives us a light weight approach to but the business value at the center of our work and make sure that assumptions that could lead to failure are clearly identified for examination \n- Start At The End is really easy and quick to facilitate, but often yields great results. It's a great technique for those new to facilitating workshops or sessions that are short on time.\n- The technique forces participants to think about failure, which many teams never do. It's surprising how much you can learn about a domain just by getting participants to share their fears. \n- It's easy to communicate the results of the session in slide ware and project rooms. We'd recommend keeping the results up in the project space throughout your effort.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- [Impact Mapping](/practices/impact-mapping/) is another practice which leads to the same outputs. Compared to Start At The End, Impact Mapping produces a higher fidelity understanding of the domain, but at the cost of increased complexity for facilitation. Generally speaking, Impact Mapping is the better fit when building products or services, and Start At The End is a better fit when discussing organizational change or other generally nebulous efforts. \n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Facilitator\n- Product Owner\n- Project Sponsor, both technical and business\n- Architects\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n1-2 hours. The session can be done without any participant prep.\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator: Easy\n- Participants: Easy\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nNone required, but 3x5 sticky notes with markers can be useful if you want participants to jot their notes down independently and then present back.\n\n## Process Phase\n\nWhen run strategically, at senior levels, Start At The End is a great way to run the \"Define the Area to Focus Upon\" phase of the Double Diamond design model[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2).\n\n\n## External Resources\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[The Sprint Book](https://www.thesprintbook.com)\n3. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812)", "draft": " false", "date": " 2018-06-08T00", "stages": " ['discovery']"},

This is a great way to capture feedback from a large number of participants in realtime over an extended period of time. By the middle/end of the Realtime Retrospective you should have:\n\n- Feedback in a timeline like fashion that are both positive and negative things\n- A capture of the mood and reaction of people over the course of time in a realtime manner\n- Lots of sticky notes on a wall\n\n\n## Why use Realtime Retrospective?\n\n- Let's face it, nobody *likes* filling out surveys, especially if it's more than 3 questions. Why not have them write unfiltered, uncensored, and quick feedback at the time they think of it? Realtime Retrospectives provide a low bar of entry and is voluntary and easy to participate anonymously.\n- For long running days or weeks with multiple sessions/activities, you can visibly see people's moods or grasp of the information in realtime\n- When running similar sessions in quick succession, you may need to improve quickly and sometimes adjust on the fly.\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- Timeline Retrospectives by Patrick Kua[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) uses a similar approach to gathering feedback in a sequential order\n- Linda Rising has a concept of the Continuous Retrospective[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3) that uses the timeline aspect of the Timeline Retrospective and to reflect on it everyday as a team.\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- \"Facilitator\" (Person to setup/cleanup)\n- People (anybody that was there during the timeframe)\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- ~10 Minutes setting up and cleaning up\n- Wall is kept up over the course of 1-5 days for active participation\n\n\n## Difficulty\n- Facilitator: Easy\n- Participants: Easy\n\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n- Drawing paper roll[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4).
