technique It was introduced by Gojko Adzic in 2012 At the end of the impact map you should have A shared understand of your efforts goal or problem statement An inventory of human behavioral changes

the aforementioned impacts Some sort of prioritization of scope andor impacts A physical or digital diagram with the above information Why use Impact Mapping Most planning activities revolve around juggling a shopping list of features as Gojko calls them Even though the features are delivered often the business objective is not achieved Impact Mapping reorients us towards delivering value not delivering features Impact Mapping introduces a very simple human centered design process and as such it is a great way to put lightweight design thinking techniques into practice Its a graphical mind map which reduces the barrier to entry for participants and facilitators alike The technique is highly adaptable because the core mind map is so simple Gojkos original text describes a 4 week

popular by Jeff Patton in 20081footnote1 Its an effective practice for creating lightweight release plans that can drive standard Agile delivery practices At the end of user story mapping you should have A backlog of scope items captured as stories or simply feature titles the team believes can be delivered in the planning window This means some items will be placed out of scope The backlog sliced into 3 iterations such that it forms the outline of plan Enough detail in the first iteration of the plan to get started with the work Why use User Story Mapping No one likes estimating work effort but its an important step in many environments User Story Mapping presents an approach to estimation that many teams find much more tolerable than practices like planning poker or tshirt sizing Many projects have a natural progression of work from beginning middle to end This progression is often lost in a traditional flat backlog User Story Mapping captures this information with a lightweight mechanism to plan out more than one iteration ie an Agile release plan User Story Mapping presents backlog items in the context of the overall business process so you dont lose sight of

activity of Walking the Walls is where someone interested in the work can walk around the physical space the associated teams are working from and get all the information they need from inspecting artefacts on the wall and from the resulting conversations Why Visualise work Visualising work helps facilitate a transparent and open way of working It helps avoid hiding information about status progress direction challenges and opportunities related to a product Traditionally such information is held in files on shared drives for example spreadsheets of project plans powerpoint slides word documents etc which has the challenge of not being accessible or known about and if found not being uptodate Where important information is constantly accessible and visible to people both speed and

it Value Stream Mapping VSM and MetricsBased Process Mapping MBPM are third generation lean process improvement techniques optimized for an extended organizational transformation effort They work in tandem where VSM is designed to view the big macro picture and make strategic decisions with executives and MBPM is designed to view the detailed micro picture and make tactical improvements with front line workers The first generation of these techniques comes from Toyotas information and material flow as documented in Lean Thinking1footnote1 and the second generation from Learning to See2footnote2 Why use VSM MBPM In the context of software delivery VSM MBPM are excellent tools to holistically analyze and optimize brownfield delivery processes including everything from requirements definition infrastructure provisioning and application development Being derived from Lean Manufacturing VSM MBPM visually represent the way work flows through an organization at both a macro and micro level from the time a customer requests a goodservice until the time a customer receives the goodservice When used together these tools are particularly effective at building shared understand throughout the various levels of an organization how work is actually done creating the urgency for improvement formulating specific data driven improvement plans preventing improvement work in a particular area that leads to suboptimization for the entire value stream process Related Practices In order to effectively deliver a session its critical you prepare with a Charteringrouteschartering exercise Who do you need No more than 10 people VSM requires decision makers usually Director or above MBPM requires front line workers for the processes being improved Suggested Time Done as documented by Karen Martin these are 23 day dedicated workshops Labs team is currently working on more abbreviated formats that fit our delivery model Difficulty Facilitator Hard Participants Medium to Hard Facilitation Materials Needed Some teams prefer whiteboards but the most common approach uses paper and PostIts Drawing paper roll3footnote3 Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes4footnote4 markers for the PostIts charcoal pencil and eraser5footnote5 to draw lines between PostIts For MBPM chalk line can be useful but not required Process Phase Both VSM MBPM document a current state map and then design a future state map for subsequent implementation Using the Double Diamond design model6footnote6 the current state mapping takes us from the middle of the Discover stage to the middle of the Define stage and the future state mapping takes us from the middle of the Define stage to the middle of Develop stage Additional
